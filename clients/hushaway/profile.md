### Primary: Parents (B2C)

**Who they are:**
- Parents and caregivers of sensitive or neurodivergent children
- UK-based
- Often exhausted, overwhelmed, seeking solutions
- Looking for practical help that actually works

**Child ages served:**

| Age Range | Recommended Sounds | Primary Use Cases |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 0-3 (Toddlers) | Ambient, nature, sleep audio | Naptime, overnight settling, car journeys |
| 3-5 (Preschool) | ASMR sounds, gentle stories | Quiet time, transition support, bedtime |
| 5-8 (Early Primary) | Daytime stories, frequencies | After-school reset, homework calm, bedtime anxiety |
| 8-10 (Upper Primary) | Stories + frequencies, binaural | Focus support, emotional regulation, sleep onset |
| 10+ (Pre-teen/Teen) | Binaural beats, frequencies, ASMR | Exam stress, anxiety, sensory overload |

## Brand Voice

### Voice Summary

HushAway® sounds like a warm, understanding parent talking to another parent. Never clinical. Never preachy. Just one exhausted parent sharing what actually works, with the calm reassurance that comes from genuine expertise.

### Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | **Casual** | Conversational, uses contractions, sentence fragments OK |
| Serious ↔ Playful | **Gently warm** | Serious topics handled with warmth, not heaviness |
| Reserved ↔ Bold | **Reassuring** | Confident but never pushy or salesy |
| Simple ↔ Sophisticated | **Simple** | Everyday language, no jargon |
| Warm ↔ Direct | **Warm** | Nurturing, empathetic, understanding |

### Personality Traits

1. **Calm** — The voice itself should feel like a moment of peace
2. **Reassuring** — "You're doing great. This is hard. Here's something that helps."
3. **Warm** — Genuinely caring, not performatively caring
4. **Parent-to-parent** — Equal footing, shared experience, no lecturing

### Vocabulary Patterns

**Use:**
- Everyday parent language
- UK English (colour, behaviour, organised)
- Contractions (it's, you're, we're, don't)
- "Your little one," "your child"
- "We know," "we've been there," "we understand"

**Avoid:**
- Clinical terminology (dysregulation → overwhelm, stimming → self-soothing movements)
- Medical jargon
- Academic language
- Anything that sounds like a doctor's report
- Industry buzzwords

### Rhythm and Structure

- Short, calming sentences
- Breathing room between ideas
- Lists when helpful, but not everything in threes
- Open with empathy, close with hope
- No overwhelming walls of text

### On-Brand vs Off-Brand

| On-Brand ✓ | Off-Brand ✗ |
|------------|-------------|
| "We know bedtime can feel like a battle. Here's a gentler way." | "Studies show that 73% of neurodivergent children experience sleep onset difficulties." |
| "Your little one isn't broken. They just experience the world differently." | "Children with sensory processing disorder require specialised interventions." |
| "Press play. That's it. No setup, no decisions, no effort." | "Our multi-modal therapeutic audio programme facilitates self-regulation." |
| "We made this because we needed it too." | "HushAway was developed by leading experts in paediatric wellness." |

### Relationship Stance

- **Peer, not expert:** We're parents who happen to have expertise, not experts lecturing parents
- **Guide, not guru:** "Here's what works for us" not "You must do this"
- **Alongside, not above:** We're in this together

### Perspective

- Use "HushAway®" (always with registration symbol) for the brand
- Use "we" for the HushAway team/voice
- Use "you" to address parents directly
- Use "your child" or "your little one" for children
