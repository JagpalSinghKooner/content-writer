# LinkedIn Content: Understanding Sensory Overload in Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
Your child wasn't "fine" 10 minutes ago.

They were already close to the edge.

Swipe → to understand what's really happening during sensory overload

### Slide 2: The Reality
Sensory overload isn't bad behaviour.

It's when the brain receives more input than it can process.

The filtering system that works automatically for other children? It works differently for yours.

### Slide 3: The Cumulative Effect
It's rarely one big trigger.

It's the scratchy clothes in the morning + the echoey hall + the wrong smell in the canteen + the bump in the corridor + the loud afternoon.

By the time they're home, one small thing tips them over.

### Slide 4: The Brain Science
When overload hits, it triggers fight-flight-freeze.

Stress hormones flood the body.
The rational thinking brain goes offline.

This is why you can't reason with them. They literally can't hear you right now.

### Slide 5: Two Types
**Hypersensitive:** The world feels too loud, too bright, too much. Their filtering system lets too much through.

**Hyposensitive:** They don't receive enough sensory input. They seek strong experiences to get what their system needs.

Many children are a mix of both.

### Slide 6: The Auditory Advantage
Sound is processed faster than any other sense.

8-10 milliseconds vs 150-200 for vision.

It has direct pathways to the brain's emotional centres. This means sound can trigger overload fast—but the right sound can also calm fast.

### Slide 7: Why Sound Works
During peak overload:
• Weighted blankets need touch tolerance (often rejected)
• Fidgets need motor control (unavailable)
• Deep breathing needs thinking brain (offline)

But sound? They just have to be in the room. No interaction required.

### Slide 8: Passive Listening
Press play. Step back. Let the sound work.

Predictable, controlled sound signals safety to the nervous system—even when everything else is overwhelming.

### Slide 9: What Actually Helps
Reduce sensory input immediately.
Stay calm yourself (your stress increases theirs).
Provide safe space without demands.
Don't ask questions or give instructions.

Use sound to give the overwhelmed nervous system something stable to anchor to.

### Slide 10: CTA
Understanding sensory overload changes everything.

Your child isn't difficult. Their nervous system processes the world differently.

Your child was fine ten minutes ago. Now they're on the floor, hands over their ears, completely unreachable.

You're exhausted. You've tried everything.

Here's what most parents aren't told about sensory overload:

It's not one big trigger. It's cumulative.

The morning started with scratchy clothes. Then the school hall was echoey. The canteen smelled wrong. A classmate bumped into them. The afternoon got too loud.

By the time they walk through your door, their sensory bucket is full to the brim. One small thing—maybe you asked how their day was—tips them over.

When sensory overload hits, it triggers the body's threat detection system. Stress hormones flood. The rational thinking brain goes offline.

This is why you can't reason with a child in sensory overload. They literally can't hear you. Not until their nervous system calms down.

But here's something that surprised us: the auditory system, the very system that often triggers overload, is also the key to helping them regulate.

Sound reaches the emotional brain faster than anything else. And the right sound—predictable, controlled, designed for sensitive ears—can help when other tools can't.

You don't have to wait for overload and then scramble. You can use sound proactively throughout the day.

Press play. Step back. Let it work.

"Why does my child cover their ears but still like certain sounds?"

This question comes up constantly. And it makes perfect sense once you understand the difference.

Unpredictable sounds trigger the brain's threat response. Sudden noises, overlapping conversations, unexpected alarms. These tell the brain there's potential danger.

Predictable, controlled sounds do the opposite. Steady rhythms, consistent volume, known patterns. These signal safety to the nervous system.

Your child might cover their ears at a fire alarm (unpredictable, alarming) but find deep calm in certain music or soundscapes (predictable, safe).

It's not about sound being good or bad. It's about whether the sound signals safety or threat.

During sensory overload, when every other intervention requires something from your child—touch tolerance, motor control, thinking brain—sound works differently.

They just have to be in the room. No interaction required. Just press play.

This is passive listening. And it's why the auditory system can be the fastest path back to calm when nothing else is working.

Here's the hard truth about sensory overload: you can't always prevent the bucket from filling during the day.

But you can help empty it when they come home.

Most sensory strategies focus on movement and touch. Weighted blankets. Fidgets. Deep breathing. All valuable.

But they require something from your child. Touch tolerance. Motor control. Cognitive load.

During peak overload? Those things aren't available.

Sound is different. The auditory nerve connects directly to the brainstem and limbic system. It reaches the emotional brain without requiring anything from the child.

No holding. No remembering. No coordinating their body.

Morning sounds help the nervous system wake gently. Transition sounds ease shifts between activities. Background sounds during homework filter out distractions. Evening sounds help wind down.

This is what a sensory diet looks like when it includes the auditory system.

And for exhausted parents? This matters. It's one intervention that doesn't require you to do more.

Press play and get on with making dinner. Press play and sit quietly together. Press play and give yourself a moment to breathe too.
