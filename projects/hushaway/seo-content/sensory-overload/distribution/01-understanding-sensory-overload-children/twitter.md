# Twitter/X Content: Understanding Sensory Overload in Children

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your child wasn't "fine" 10 minutes ago.

They were already at the edge. Here's what's really happening during sensory overload.

🧵 Thread:

### Tweet 2
Sensory overload = the brain receives more input than it can process.

The filtering system that works automatically for other children? It works differently for yours.

### Tweet 3
It's rarely one big trigger.

Morning: scratchy clothes
School: echoey hall, wrong smells, bumps in corridor, loud afternoon

By home time, the sensory bucket is full. One small thing tips them over.

### Tweet 4
When overload hits, it triggers fight-flight-freeze.

Stress hormones flood. Rational thinking brain goes offline.

This is why you can't reason with them. They literally can't hear you right now.

### Tweet 5
Two types:

**Hypersensitive:** World feels too loud, bright, much. Filtering system lets too much through.

**Hyposensitive:** Don't receive enough input. Seek strong experiences.

Many children are a mix of both.

### Tweet 6
Here's what surprised us:

Sound is processed faster than any other sense (8-10ms vs 150-200ms for vision).

Direct pathways to emotional centres = can trigger overload fast, but right sound can also calm fast.

### Tweet 7
During peak overload:
• Weighted blankets need touch tolerance (often rejected)
• Fidgets need motor control (unavailable)
• Deep breathing needs thinking brain (offline)

But sound? They just have to be in the room.

### Tweet 8
This is passive listening.

Press play. Step back. Let the sound work.

Predictable, controlled sound signals safety to the nervous system—even when everything else is overwhelming.

### Tweet 9
What helps during active overload:
• Reduce sensory input immediately
• Stay calm yourself (your stress increases theirs)
• Safe space without demands
• Don't ask questions or give instructions
• Use sound to give them something stable to anchor to

### Tweet 10
TL;DR:

• Sensory overload is neurological, not behavioural
• It's cumulative (the bucket fills all day)
• Sound reaches emotional brain fastest
• Passive listening requires nothing from your child
• Use sound proactively, not just in crisis

### Tweet 11 (CTA)
Your child isn't difficult. Their nervous system processes the world differently.

Understanding this changes everything.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Sensory overload isn't one big trigger.

It's the scratchy tag + echoey hall + wrong smell + bump in corridor + loud afternoon.

By the time they're home, one small thing tips a bucket that's been filling all day.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
You can't reason with a child in sensory overload.

Their thinking brain is offline. Stress response is in control.

Don't try to talk them through it. Create space, reduce input, and give them something stable to anchor to.

### Tweet C (Paradox)
"Why does my child cover their ears but still like certain sounds?"

Unpredictable sound = threat signal
Predictable sound = safety signal

It's not about loud vs quiet. It's about whether the sound tells their nervous system "danger" or "safe."

### Tweet D (The Science)
Sound reaches the emotional brain in 8-10 milliseconds.

Vision takes 150-200 milliseconds.

This is why sound can trigger overload faster than anything else—and why the right sound can calm faster too.

### Tweet E (The Reality)
Sensory overload looks like:
• Hands over ears
• Trying to escape
• Complete shutdown
• Aggression

But underneath? A nervous system that's hit a wall. No amount of reasoning will change that in the moment.
