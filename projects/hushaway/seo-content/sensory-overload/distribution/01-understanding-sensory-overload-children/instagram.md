# Instagram Content: Understanding Sensory Overload in Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
YOUR CHILD WASN'T "FINE" 10 MINUTES AGO

They were already at the edge

[Bold, high-contrast text on calming background colour]

### Slide 2: The Reality
Sensory overload isn't bad behaviour

It's when the brain receives more input than it can process

The filtering system works differently for your child

### Slide 3: The Bucket
It's not one big trigger

Morning: scratchy clothes
School: echoey hall
Lunch: wrong smells
Afternoon: too loud

By home time, one small thing tips them over

### Slide 4: The Brain
When overload hits:
Stress hormones flood
Thinking brain goes offline

This is why you can't reason with them right now

### Slide 5: Two Types
HYPERSENSITIVE
World feels too loud, bright, much

HYPOSENSITIVE
Seeks strong input to feel enough

Many children are both

### Slide 6: The Speed of Sound
Sound reaches the emotional brain in 8-10 milliseconds

Vision takes 150-200 milliseconds

This is why sound works so fast

### Slide 7: Why Sound Helps
During overload:
❌ Weighted blankets need touch tolerance
❌ Fidgets need motor control
❌ Breathing needs thinking brain

✓ Sound just needs them in the room

### Slide 8: Passive Listening
Press play
Step back
Let the sound work

No interaction required

### Slide 9: What Helps
• Reduce sensory input now
• Stay calm yourself
• Create safe space
• No questions or instructions
• Use predictable sound

### Slide 10: CTA
Understanding changes everything

Your child isn't difficult
Their nervous system just works differently

## Caption

Your child was fine ten minutes ago. Now they're on the floor, hands over their ears, completely unreachable.

.
.
.

You're exhausted. You've tried everything. And you're wondering if you're doing something wrong.

You're not.

This is sensory overload. And it's not what most parents think it is.

It's rarely one big trigger. It's cumulative. The scratchy clothes in the morning, the echoey hall, the wrong smell, the bump in the corridor, the loud afternoon. By the time they walk through your door, their sensory bucket is full to the brim.

One small thing tips them over.

When overload hits, it triggers fight-flight-freeze. The rational thinking brain goes offline. This is why you can't reason with them. They literally can't hear you right now.

But here's what surprised us: the auditory system, the very system that often triggers overload, is also the key to helping them regulate.

Sound reaches the emotional brain faster than any other sense. And the right sound—predictable, controlled, designed for sensitive ears—can help when other tools can't.

During peak overload, weighted blankets need touch tolerance (often rejected). Fidgets need motor control (unavailable). Deep breathing needs thinking brain (offline).

But sound? They just have to be in the room. Press play. Step back. Let it work.

Your child isn't difficult. Their nervous system processes the world differently. And understanding that changes everything.

## Reel Script (25 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
[Visual: Parent looking exhausted, child covering ears on floor]
"Your child wasn't 'fine' 10 minutes ago."

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
[Text overlay appears with each point]
"They were already at the edge.

Here's what sensory overload really is:

Not one big trigger—it's cumulative
The bucket filled all day long
By home time, one small thing tips them over

When it hits, their thinking brain goes offline
You can't reason with them
They literally can't hear you"

**[20-25 seconds: CTA]**
[Visual: Calm child with headphones, peaceful environment]
"But the right sound can help when nothing else works.

## Visual Notes

**Carousel Design:**
- Calming colour palette: soft blues, gentle greens, warm neutrals
- High contrast text (dark on light or light on dark)
- Minimum 40pt font for headlines, 28pt for body text
- Simple, clean design (avoid visual clutter—this is about sensory calm)
- Consistent design system across all slides
- Consider subtle texture or gradient rather than solid colours

**Reel B-roll Suggestions:**
- Parent and child in calm moment
- Child with headphones in peaceful space
- Sensory-friendly room setup
- Close-ups of calm, regulated child
- Visual representation of "bucket filling" (use metaphor)
- Avoid chaotic, overstimulating visuals (practice what we preach)

**Colour Psychology:**
- Blue: Calm, trust, safety
- Green: Growth, balance, nature
- Warm neutrals: Comfort, grounding
- Avoid: Harsh reds, neon, high-intensity colours
