# Newsletter Snippet: Understanding Sensory Overload in Children

## Hook

Your child was fine ten minutes ago. Now they're on the floor, hands clamped over their ears, completely unreachable. And you're wondering what you did wrong.

## Body

You didn't do anything wrong. This is sensory overload—and it's not what most parents think it is.

Here's what's really happening: sensory overload isn't about one big trigger. It's cumulative. The scratchy clothes in the morning, the echoey school hall, the wrong smell in the canteen, the bump in the corridor, the loud afternoon. By the time they walk through your door, their sensory bucket is full to the brim. One small thing—maybe you just asked how their day was—tips them over.

When sensory overload hits, it triggers the body's threat detection system. Stress hormones flood the body. The rational thinking brain goes offline. This is why you can't reason with a child in sensory overload. They literally can't hear you. Not until their nervous system calms down.

But here's something most parents aren't told: the auditory system, the very system that often triggers overload, is also the key to helping them regulate. Sound reaches the emotional brain faster than any other sense. And the right sound—predictable, controlled, designed for sensitive ears—can help when other tools can't.

We've written a complete guide to understanding what's really happening in your child's brain during sensory overload, why the auditory system holds the key to regulation, and what actually helps in the moment.
