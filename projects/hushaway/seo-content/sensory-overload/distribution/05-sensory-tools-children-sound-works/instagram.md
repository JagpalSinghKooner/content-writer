# Instagram Content: Sensory Tools for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
YOUR DRAWER FULL OF
SENSORY TOOLS
DOESN'T WORK

(Here's why they fail
& what actually does)

### Slide 2: The Drawer
The weighted blanket rejected after two uses.

The fidget cube lost under the sofa.

The chewy necklace still in its packaging.

Every purchase made sense. But during overload? They all fail.

### Slide 3: The Problem
Most sensory tools work for PREVENTION.

But during peak overload, they require abilities that overload takes away.

### Slide 4: What Goes Offline
During sensory overload:

✗ Motor control (can't use fidgets)
✗ Touch tolerance (blankets feel crushing)
✗ Cognitive capacity (can't follow instructions)
✗ Physical proximity (hugs feel like attacks)

### Slide 5: Weighted Blankets
✓ Wind-down time
✓ Mild anxiety
✓ When child chooses them

✗ Peak overload
✗ When touch is intolerable

LIMITATION: Require touch tolerance

### Slide 6: Fidgets
✓ Low-level restlessness
✓ Before stress escalates

✗ During crisis
✗ When coordination is gone

LIMITATION: Require motor control

### Slide 7: Why Sound Works
Sound requires NOTHING from your child.

No motor control
No touch tolerance
No cognitive processing
No choices

Just press play.

### Slide 8: The Sound Difference
Not all sound works.

What makes therapeutic sound different:

• Predictable (no sudden changes)
• Controlled volume (for sensitive ears)
• Specific frequencies
• No demands

### Slide 9: Sound-Sensitive Kids
"But my child is sound sensitive!"

The sounds that overwhelm: Unpredictable, sudden, uncontrollable

Therapeutic sound: Predictable, controlled, designed for sensitive ears

Not all sound is the same.

### Slide 10: CTA
Don't throw out the sensory drawer.

Match the tool to the moment:

Prevention → Weighted blankets, fidgets
Crisis → Sound
Recovery → Gentle sound, rest

## Caption

The weighted blanket worked twice. Then your child refused to go near it.

You've got a drawer full of sensory tools. And during peak overload? None of them work.

.
.
.

Here's what nobody tells you: most sensory tools work brilliantly for prevention. But during crisis, they require abilities that overload takes away.

Motor control disappears. Touch tolerance drops. Cognitive capacity vanishes. The tools you have need the very abilities that crisis steals.

Sound is different. It requires nothing from your child. No motor control. No touch tolerance. No choices. Just press play.

Sound bypasses every system that goes offline during overload. It works from a distance. You can press play and step back, giving them the space they need whilst still doing something to help.

Don't throw out the sensory drawer. Weighted blankets, fidgets, and movement have their place. Use them for prevention and mild stress.

But during peak overload, when your child can't engage with anything else? Sound is the tool that works when everything else fails.

The drawer isn't complete without it.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"You've got a drawer full of sensory tools that don't work during meltdowns. Here's why."

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
"Most sensory tools work for prevention. But during peak overload?

They fail.

Because weighted blankets require touch tolerance. Fidgets require motor control. Chewies require coordination.

Sound requires nothing. No motor control. No touch. No choices.

Just press play."

**[20-30 seconds: CTA]**
"Sound works when everything else can't. The sensory drawer isn't complete without it.

Explore The Open Sanctuary for sounds designed for sensitive children."
