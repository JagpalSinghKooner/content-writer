# LinkedIn Content: Sensory Tools for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
You've got a drawer full of sensory tools that don't work.

The weighted blanket rejected. The fidget cube lost under the sofa. The chewy necklace still in its packaging.

Swipe → to learn why they fail (and what actually works)

### Slide 2: The Problem
Most sensory tools work brilliantly for prevention.

But during peak overload?

They fail.

Not because they're bad products. Because they require abilities that overload takes away.

### Slide 3: What Overload Takes Away
During peak sensory overload:

• Motor control disappears (can't use fidgets)
• Touch tolerance drops (weighted blankets feel crushing)
• Cognitive capacity vanishes (can't follow instructions)
• Physical proximity feels threatening (hugs become attacks)

Your child can't engage with tools that require these abilities.

### Slide 4: Weighted Blankets
✓ When they work:
Wind-down time, mild anxiety, when the child chooses to use them

✗ When they fail:
Peak overload (touch becomes intolerable), when the child can't adjust or remove it

The limitation: Weighted blankets require touch tolerance. During overload, that's often gone.

### Slide 5: Fidgets
✓ When they work:
Low-level restlessness, before stress escalates

✗ When they fail:
During crisis (no fine motor control), when visual or tactile input adds to overwhelm

The limitation: Fidgets require coordination. During peak overload, that ability isn't available.

### Slide 6: Why Sound Is Different
Sound requires nothing from your child.

No motor control. No touch tolerance. No cognitive processing. No choices.

Just press play.

Sound bypasses every system that goes offline during overload.

### Slide 7: The Sound Difference
Not all sound works.

Random music or TV won't help.

What works:
• Predictable (no sudden changes)
• Controlled volume (designed for sensitive ears)
• Specific frequencies (ASMR, solfeggio, nature sounds)
• No demands (doesn't require engagement)

### Slide 8: The Right Tool for the Right Job
Prevention tools (before overload):
Weighted blankets, fidgets, heavy work, chewing items

Crisis tools (during overload):
Sound. Primarily sound.

Recovery tools (after crisis):
Gentle sound, rest, low-demand presence

### Slide 9: What About Sound-Sensitive Children?
The sounds that overwhelm are unpredictable:
Alarms. Crowds. Sudden noises. Sounds they can't control.

Therapeutic sound is the opposite:
Predictable. Controlled. Designed for sensitive ears.

Not all sound is the same.

### Slide 10: CTA
The sensory drawer isn't complete without sound.

Unlike the fidget under the sofa or the rejected weighted blanket, sound is always ready when you need it.

## Text Post 1

The weighted blanket worked twice. Then your child refused to go near it.

The fidget cube disappeared under the sofa three weeks ago. The chewy necklace is still in its packaging because the texture was "wrong."

Every single purchase made sense at the time. Every single one promised to help.

Here's what nobody tells you: most sensory tools for children work brilliantly for prevention. But during peak overload? They fail.

Not because they're bad products. Because they're designed for a different job entirely.

During peak sensory overload, certain abilities go offline:

• Motor control becomes difficult (can't use fidgets or play with putty)
• Touch tolerance drops dramatically (the weighted blanket now feels crushing)
• Cognitive capacity disappears (can't follow instructions or make choices)
• Physical proximity feels threatening (the hug that usually helps now feels like an attack)

The tools you have require the very abilities that overload takes away.

Sound is fundamentally different.

It requires nothing from your child. Nothing. They don't have to hold anything. They don't have to tolerate touch. They don't have to make choices, follow instructions, or move their body.

Just press play. That's it.

Sound bypasses every offline system. Motor control? Not needed. Cognitive processing? Not required. Touch tolerance? Irrelevant.

And sound works from a distance. You don't have to be near your child. You can press play and step back, giving them the space they need while still doing something to help.

Don't throw out the sensory drawer. Weighted blankets, fidgets, and movement all have their place. Use them for prevention and mild stress.

But during peak overload, when your child can't engage with anything else?

Sound is the tool that works when everything else fails.

The drawer isn't complete without it.

## Text Post 2

"But my child is sound sensitive. Won't this make things worse?"

We hear this question constantly about using sound as a sensory tool.

And we understand why you'd think that. It seems counterintuitive.

But here's the distinction that matters:

The sounds that overwhelm your child are unpredictable. Alarms. Crowds. Overlapping voices. Sudden noises. Sounds they can't control or anticipate.

Therapeutic sound is the opposite of all that.

It's predictable. Controlled. Designed specifically for sensitive ears. Your child knows what's coming. There are no surprises waiting to spike their nervous system.

Think about it this way:

A fire alarm makes your child cover their ears and melt down. That's unpredictable, loud, jarring sound.

A gentle ASMR soundscape with consistent volume and no sudden changes? That's therapeutic sound designed for regulation.

Not all sound is the same.

The wrong sound overwhelms. The right sound regulates.

Sound-sensitive children can absolutely benefit from therapeutic sound. Many of our parents report that sound is the only thing that reaches their child during peak overload.

Because it's not about blocking sound (ear defenders do that). It's about providing predictable auditory input that the nervous system can anchor to.

Your sound-sensitive child isn't rejecting all sound. They're rejecting unpredictable, overwhelming sound.

Give them sound designed for their nervous system instead.
