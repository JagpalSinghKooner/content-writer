# Twitter/X Content: After-School Sensory Overload

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your child is fine at school.

Gets home. Explodes.

It's not you. It's restraint collapse.

Here's what's actually happening (and what to play first):

🧵

### Tweet 2
School is a sensory assault course.

6 hours of:
• Fluorescent lights
• Constant noise
• Reading faces
• Sitting still
• Performing "normal"

Their nervous system has been running at maximum capacity.

### Tweet 3
When they walk through the door, they're not melting down AT you.

They're melting down BECAUSE OF you.

Home is the only place they feel safe enough to fall apart.

That's not rejection. That's trust.

### Tweet 4
Here's what makes it worse:

"How was your day?"

This requires memory retrieval, thought organisation, word finding.

When cognitive resources are depleted, this simple question feels impossible.

### Tweet 5
What your child needs first isn't questions, snacks, or hugs.

It's sound.

The auditory system processes faster than any other sense. It connects directly to the brain's emotional regulation centres.

### Tweet 6
Sound bypasses the demands that make everything else impossible:

✓ No decisions required
✓ No touch tolerance needed
✓ No cognitive load
✓ No motor control necessary

Just press play.

### Tweet 7
The after-school reset protocol:

1. Sound on before they're through the door
2. No questions for 20 minutes
3. Create a landing zone
4. Snacks within reach, not offered
5. Wait for the signal

### Tweet 8
What to play:

✓ Frequencies (solfeggio)
✓ ASMR soundscapes
✓ Ambient sounds

✗ Music with lyrics
✗ Complex melodies
✗ Variable dynamics

Predictable. Low-demand. Sensory-safe.

### Tweet 9
After 15-30 minutes, most children emerge.

Ready to talk. Ready to reconnect. Ready to be present.

The conversation you wanted? It happens. Just not in the first twenty minutes.

### Tweet 10 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• After-school meltdown = restraint collapse
• It's not personal, it's nervous system recovery
• Questions/hugs/food make it worse
• Sound works when nothing else does
• Press play, step back, wait 20 minutes

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
After-school meltdown isn't bad behaviour.

It's proof you've created a space where they feel safe enough to fall apart.

That's not failure. That's trust.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

Stop asking "how was your day?" the moment they walk through the door.

Your neurodivergent child needs silence first, conversation later.

20 minutes of calming sounds > 20 questions they can't answer.

### Tweet C (List)
Why your child melts down AT HOME but not at school:

• School = perform "normal" at all costs
• Home = safe to release
• Masking takes enormous energy
• They've been holding it for 6 hours
• You're the person they trust most

It's restraint collapse. Not bad parenting.

### Tweet D (Proof)
Tried the after-school reset with calming sounds:

✓ Meltdowns shorter
✓ Recovery faster
✓ Less screaming
✓ More connection (after the quiet window)

Sound first. Questions later. Game changer.

### Tweet E (Question)
Parents of neurodivergent kids:

What's the first thing your child does when they get home from school?

Mine used to explode. Now I have calming sounds already playing. Different child.
