# Instagram Content: After-School Sensory Overload

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
YOUR CHILD MELTS DOWN
THE MOMENT THEY GET HOME

It's not you.
It's sensory debt.

[High contrast text on calming background]

### Slide 2: What's Happening
School = 6 hours of sensory assault

✗ Fluorescent lights
✗ Constant noise
✗ Reading faces
✗ Sitting still
✗ Performing "normal"

Their nervous system is flooded.

### Slide 3: Restraint Collapse
They've been holding it together all day.

Home is the ONLY place they feel safe enough to fall apart.

The meltdown isn't rejection.
It's trust.

### Slide 4: Why Questions Make It Worse
"How was your day?"

Requires:
• Memory retrieval
• Thought organisation
• Word finding
• Social performance

When they're depleted, this feels impossible.

### Slide 5: Why Sound Works
The auditory system processes FASTER than any other sense.

Sound bypasses everything else:
✓ No decisions
✓ No touch needed
✓ No thinking required
✓ No movement needed

### Slide 6: The After-School Reset
1. Sound on BEFORE they walk in
2. No questions for 20 minutes
3. Create a landing zone
4. Snacks within reach (not offered)
5. Wait for the signal

### Slide 7: What to Play
✓ Solfeggio frequencies
✓ ASMR soundscapes
✓ Ambient sounds

✗ Music with lyrics
✗ Complex melodies
✗ Anything unpredictable

### Slide 8: The Signal
After 15-30 minutes, they'll emerge.

Ready to talk.
Ready to connect.
Ready to be present.

The conversation happens.
Just not first.

### Slide 9: What This Means
Your child isn't "saving it for you."

They're trusting you with the parts they can't show anyone else.

That's love.

### Slide 10: CTA

## Caption

Your child is fine at school. Gets home. Explodes.

.
.
.

Here's what's actually happening.

School is a sensory assault course. Six hours of fluorescent lights, constant noise, reading faces, sitting still, performing "normal." For a neurodivergent or sensitive child, this is exhausting at a cellular level.

There's a name for what you're seeing: restraint collapse. They've been holding it together all day. When they reach you, they've got nothing left.

The meltdown isn't about you doing something wrong. It's proof you've created a space where they feel safe enough to fall apart. That's not failure. That's trust.

What your child needs first isn't questions, snacks, or hugs. It's sound. The auditory system processes faster than any other sense. Sound bypasses the demands that make everything else impossible.

The after-school reset: Sound on before they walk in. No questions for 20 minutes. A landing zone with calming sounds. Snacks within reach, not offered. Wait for the signal.

After 15-30 minutes, most children emerge. Ready to talk. Ready to reconnect. The conversation you wanted? It happens. Just not in the first twenty minutes.

Your child isn't "saving it for you." They're trusting you with the parts they can't show anyone else.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your child walks through the door and immediately melts down. Here's why."

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
"School is a sensory assault course. Six hours of lights, noise, social demands, sitting still. They've been holding it together all day.

When they reach you, they crash. It's called restraint collapse.

What they need first: Sound. Not questions. Not snacks. Not hugs. Sound.

Press play. Step back. Wait 20 minutes."

## Visual Notes

**Carousel Design:**
- Calming colour palette: soft blues, gentle greens, warm neutrals
- High contrast text for readability
- Minimal design, lots of white space
- Each slide: one main point only
- Use simple icons where helpful (sound waves, home icon, clock)

**Reel B-roll Suggestions:**
- Child walking through door (back view for privacy)
- Close-up of speaker/tablet playing sounds
- Calming visual of designated landing zone
- Parent and child reconnecting after reset (warm, peaceful moment)
- Text overlays for key points
- Soothing ambient visuals (nature, abstract calming patterns)
