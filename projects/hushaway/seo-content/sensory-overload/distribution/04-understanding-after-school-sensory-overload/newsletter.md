# Newsletter Snippet: After-School Sensory Overload

## Hook

Your child walks through the door. You smile. You ask how their day was. And it all falls apart.

The after-school meltdown feels personal. It isn't.

## Body

Your child has just spent six hours performing "normal" in an environment not designed for their nervous system. School demands sitting still, reading social cues, tolerating sensory input with no escape. When they finally reach you, their system crashes.

There's a name for this: restraint collapse. They've been holding it together all day. Home is the one place they feel safe enough to fall apart.

What your child needs first isn't questions, snacks, or hugs. It's sound. The auditory system processes faster than any other sense and connects directly to the brain's emotional regulation centres. Sound bypasses the demands that make everything else impossible.

The after-school reset: Sound on before they're through the door. No questions for 20 minutes. A designated landing zone. Snacks within reach, not offered. Then wait. After 15-30 minutes, most children emerge, ready to reconnect.

## CTA

The conversation you wanted? It happens. Just not in the first twenty minutes.
