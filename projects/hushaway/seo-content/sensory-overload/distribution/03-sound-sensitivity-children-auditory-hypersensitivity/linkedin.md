# LinkedIn Content: Sound Sensitivity in Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
Your child covers their ears at every noise.

So how could sound possibly help them?

Swipe → to understand the paradox that changes everything

### Slide 2: What Parents Miss
Sound-sensitive children aren't reacting to sound itself.

They're reacting to unpredictable, uncontrollable, overwhelming sound.

There's a massive difference.

### Slide 3: The Paradox
Ear defenders block all sound. Sometimes that's exactly what's needed.

But blocking sound doesn't regulate the nervous system.

It removes input. Absence isn't the same as presence.

### Slide 4: What Triggers vs What Calms
**Triggering noise:**
• Unpredictable timing
• Variable volume
• Harsh frequencies
• No end point

**Therapeutic sound:**
• Predictable pattern
• Consistent volume
• Safe frequencies
• Defined duration

### Slide 5: The Science
Research shows certain sounds produce measurable physiological changes.

Reduced heart rate. Increased emotional engagement.

Not by being absent. By being present in exactly the right way.

### Slide 6: What This Looks Like
Your child comes home from school completely overwhelmed.

Silence alone won't bring them down from high alert.

Therapeutic sound gives their nervous system something to anchor to while everything else feels chaotic inside.

### Slide 7: They Already Know This
Watch closely.

The same child who screams at hand dryers might hum to themselves constantly.

They're already self-regulating with sound. They just need the right sounds made accessible.

### Slide 8: When It Works Best
• After school (reset before homework)
• During transitions (predictable input during change)
• Before bed (wind down overactive nervous system)
• During recovery (after meltdown peaks)

### Slide 9: Quick Recap
✓ Sound-sensitive ≠ needs silence
✓ Therapeutic sound ≠ triggering noise
✓ Predictable patterns calm the nervous system
✓ Your child may already self-regulate with sound
✓ The right sound can help more than blocking all sound

Your child covers their ears at fire alarms, hand dryers, and birthday parties.

You've spent years protecting them from sound. Leaving early. Avoiding places. Carrying ear defenders everywhere.

And now someone tells you sound could actually help them?

We know how backwards that feels.

Here's what most parents don't understand about auditory hypersensitivity:

Your child isn't reacting to sound itself. They're reacting to unpredictable, uncontrollable, overwhelming sound.

There's a world of difference between noise that overwhelms and sound that regulates.

Triggering noise: Unpredictable timing, variable volume, harsh frequencies, overlapping sources, no end point.

Therapeutic sound: Predictable pattern, consistent volume, safe frequencies, single clear source, defined duration.

When you understand this distinction, using sound for a sound-sensitive child stops feeling contradictory.

You're not adding more noise. You're replacing chaos with pattern. Overwhelm with calm.

The same child who screams at hand dryers might hum to themselves constantly. The same child who covers their ears at parties might watch the same video clip fifteen times in a row, specifically for its sound.

They're already self-regulating with sound. They just need the right sounds made accessible.

After school, when their nervous system has been in survival mode for six hours, silence alone won't bring them down from high alert. They're still activated with nothing to anchor to.

Therapeutic sound gives their nervous system a focal point. Something consistent to land on while everything else feels chaotic inside.

This isn't theory. Parents use this every day.

What's your experience with sound-sensitive children? Have you noticed them seeking certain sounds while avoiding others?

The child who covers their ears at every noise could become the child who asks for "their calm sound" after school.

We've seen it happen more often than you'd expect.

Here's why therapeutic sound works for auditory hypersensitivity when generic "calming sounds" don't:

A rain soundtrack might seem calming. But if it includes sudden thunder or birds chirping at random intervals, a sound-sensitive child's nervous system stays on alert. Waiting. Bracing for the next unpredictable element.

Sound designed for neurodivergent children considers every detail:
• No sudden volume changes
• No unexpected frequencies appearing mid-track
• Predictable patterns the brain can anticipate
• Frequencies chosen for their regulating properties
• Consistent enough to be background, engaging enough to anchor attention

Their ears detect every variation, every inconsistency, every moment of unpredictability that neurotypical listeners filter out without even noticing.

They need sound specifically designed for how they hear. Not adapted from something else. Built for them.

Start with low volume. Lower than you think necessary. A sound-sensitive child will hear it even when it feels barely audible to you.

Don't require anything. Don't ask them to listen. Don't ask if they like it. Just let the sound exist in the space. Background. No pressure.

Some children gravitate towards it immediately. Others need several exposures before they connect it with feeling calm. Both are completely normal.

The goal isn't to convince them to listen. It's to make therapeutic sound available when they need it.
