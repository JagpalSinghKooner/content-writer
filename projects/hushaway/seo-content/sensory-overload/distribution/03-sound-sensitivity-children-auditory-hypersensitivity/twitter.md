# Twitter/X Content: Sound Sensitivity in Children

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your child covers their ears at every noise.

So how could sound possibly help them?

The paradox that changes everything for parents of sound-sensitive children:

🧵 Thread:

### Tweet 2
1. Sound-sensitive children aren't reacting to sound itself.

They're reacting to unpredictable, uncontrollable, overwhelming sound.

Massive difference.

### Tweet 3
2. Triggering noise has these characteristics:

• Unpredictable timing (fire alarms, dogs barking)
• Variable volume (suddenly louder or quieter)
• Harsh frequencies (high-pitched, sharp, metallic)
• No end point (you don't know when it will stop)

### Tweet 4
3. Therapeutic sound is completely different:

• Predictable pattern (nervous system can relax into it)
• Consistent volume (no sudden spikes)
• Safe frequencies (designed for sensitive ears)
• Defined duration (certainty about what's coming)

### Tweet 5
4. Ear defenders block all sound. Sometimes that's exactly what's needed.

But blocking sound doesn't regulate the nervous system. It removes input.

Absence isn't the same as presence.

5. After school, your child's nervous system has been in survival mode for six hours.

Silence alone won't bring them down from high alert. They're still activated with nothing to anchor to.

Therapeutic sound gives their nervous system a focal point.

6. Watch closely and you'll notice:

The same child who screams at hand dryers might hum to themselves constantly.

They're already self-regulating with sound. They just need the right sounds made accessible.

7. Sound designed for neurodivergent children considers every detail:

• No sudden volume changes
• No unexpected frequencies appearing mid-track
• Predictable patterns the brain can anticipate
• Frequencies chosen for their regulating properties

### Tweet 9
8. When to try therapeutic sound:

✓ After school (reset before homework)
✓ During transitions (predictable input during change)
✓ Before bed (wind down overactive nervous system)
✓ During recovery (after meltdown peaks)

### Tweet 10 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Sound-sensitive ≠ needs silence
• Therapeutic sound ≠ triggering noise
• Predictable patterns calm the nervous system
• Your child may already self-regulate with sound

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Your sound-sensitive child already self-regulates with sound.

The same child who covers their ears at hand dryers hums to themselves constantly.

They don't hate sound. They hate sounds that overwhelm them.

Big difference.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

Sound-sensitive children don't need silence.

They need the right sound.

Ear defenders block input. Therapeutic sound provides regulating input.

Different tools for different needs.

### Tweet C (List)
5 signs your child is already self-regulating with sound:

• Humming to themselves constantly
• Watching the same video clip repeatedly (for the sound)
• Making clicking or tapping sounds
• Seeking specific background noise
• Requesting the same music over and over

Which one does your child do?

### Tweet D (Question)
Why does your sound-sensitive child scream at hand dryers but hum constantly?

Because unpredictable, harsh sounds overwhelm them.

But controlled, predictable sounds help them regulate.

They're not contradicting themselves. They're showing you exactly what they need.

### Tweet E (Proof)
Research shows certain sounds produce measurable physiological changes:

• Reduced heart rate
• Increased emotional engagement
• Nervous system regulation

Not by being absent. By being present in exactly the right way.

This isn't theory. It's neuroscience.
