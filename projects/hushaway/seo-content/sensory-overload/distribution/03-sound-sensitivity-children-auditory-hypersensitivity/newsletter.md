# Newsletter Snippet: Sound Sensitivity in Children

## Hook

Your child covers their ears at fire alarms, hand dryers, birthday parties. You've spent years protecting them from sound. So how could sound possibly help them?

## Body

Here's what most parents don't understand about auditory hypersensitivity: your child isn't reacting to sound itself. They're reacting to unpredictable, uncontrollable, overwhelming sound.

There's a world of difference between noise that overwhelms and sound that regulates. Triggering noise arrives without warning, at random volumes, with harsh frequencies and no end point. Therapeutic sound has a predictable pattern, consistent volume, safe frequencies, and defined duration.

When you understand this distinction, using sound for a sound-sensitive child stops feeling contradictory. You're not adding more noise. You're replacing chaos with pattern. Overwhelm with calm.

Watch closely and you'll notice: the same child who screams at hand dryers might hum to themselves constantly. The same child who covers their ears at parties might watch the same video clip fifteen times in a row, specifically for its sound. They're already self-regulating with sound. They just need the right sounds made accessible.
