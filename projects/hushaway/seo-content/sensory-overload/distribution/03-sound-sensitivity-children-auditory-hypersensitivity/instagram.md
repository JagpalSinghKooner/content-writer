# Instagram Content: Sound Sensitivity in Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
YOUR CHILD COVERS THEIR EARS AT EVERY NOISE

So how could sound possibly help them?

[Bold text, high contrast - calming colours]

### Slide 2: The Paradox
Sound-sensitive children aren't reacting to sound itself

They're reacting to unpredictable, uncontrollable, overwhelming sound

### Slide 3: What Triggers
Triggering noise:
✗ Unpredictable timing
✗ Variable volume
✗ Harsh frequencies
✗ No end point

### Slide 4: What Calms
Therapeutic sound:
✓ Predictable pattern
✓ Consistent volume
✓ Safe frequencies
✓ Defined duration

### Slide 5: The Missing Piece
Ear defenders block all sound

But blocking sound doesn't regulate the nervous system

Absence isn't the same as presence

### Slide 6: After School
Your child's nervous system has been in survival mode for 6 hours

Silence alone won't bring them down from high alert

Therapeutic sound gives their nervous system something to anchor to

### Slide 7: They Already Know
The same child who screams at hand dryers might hum to themselves constantly

They're already self-regulating with sound

### Slide 8: When It Works
✓ After school
✓ During transitions
✓ Before bed
✓ During recovery

### Slide 9: What's Different
Sound designed for neurodivergent children:
• No sudden volume changes
• No unexpected frequencies
• Predictable patterns
• Regulating frequencies

### Slide 10: CTA

## Caption

Your child covers their ears at fire alarms, hand dryers, birthday parties. You've spent years protecting them from sound.

And now someone tells you sound could actually help them?

.
.
.

Here's what most parents don't understand about auditory hypersensitivity: your child isn't reacting to sound itself. They're reacting to unpredictable, uncontrollable, overwhelming sound.

There's a world of difference between noise that overwhelms and sound that regulates.

Triggering noise has unpredictable timing, variable volume, harsh frequencies, and no end point. Therapeutic sound has a predictable pattern, consistent volume, safe frequencies, and defined duration.

When you understand this distinction, using sound for a sound-sensitive child stops feeling contradictory. You're not adding more noise. You're replacing chaos with pattern.

Watch closely and you'll notice: the same child who screams at hand dryers might hum to themselves constantly. They're already self-regulating with sound. They just need the right sounds made accessible.

After school, when their nervous system has been in survival mode for six hours, silence alone won't bring them down from high alert. Therapeutic sound gives their nervous system a focal point. Something consistent to land on while everything else feels chaotic inside.

## Visual Notes

**Carousel design:**
- Colours: Calming blues, soft greens, cream backgrounds (sensory-safe palette)
- Fonts: Clean, highly readable sans-serif (dyslexia-friendly)
- Visual hierarchy: Large statement text on slides 1, 3, 4 with supporting text smaller
- Contrast: High contrast for accessibility
- Icons: Simple checkmarks and crosses for triggers vs calming elements

**Reel B-roll suggestions:**
- Child with ear defenders (visual everyone recognises)
- Contrast of chaotic sound waves vs smooth, predictable sound waves
- Parent pressing play on speaker (simple, relatable action)
- Child in calm corner with gentle sound playing
- Text overlays for key points (many watch with sound off)
