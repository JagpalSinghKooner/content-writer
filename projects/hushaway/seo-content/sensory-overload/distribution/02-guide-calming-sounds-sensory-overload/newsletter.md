# Newsletter Snippet: Calming Sounds for Sensory Overload

## Hook

Your child is in sensory overload. Crying. Shaking. Hands over ears. You reach for the weighted blanket—they throw it off. You offer a fidget toy—they can't hold it. You try deep breathing—they can't hear you. Every tool you've been told works requires something your child cannot give in that moment.

## Body

Here's what most parents don't realise: sound works when everything else fails. Your child can hear even when they can't process anything else. Sound reaches them without demanding anything back.

During sensory overload, weighted blankets need them to tolerate touch. Fidgets need motor control. Deep pressure needs them to accept physical contact. Breathing exercises need them to follow instructions and coordinate their body. Every single one requires something.

Sound requires nothing. Your child doesn't need to reach for it, hold it, or do anything with it. They don't need to follow instructions or coordinate their muscles. The sound simply exists in the space around them. It enters through their ears without asking permission.

Research on Polyvagal Theory shows that certain sound frequencies signal safety to the nervous system. Predictable patterns calm the brain. Specific frequencies activate the parasympathetic nervous system—the "rest and digest" mode. Passive input bypasses the overwhelmed prefrontal cortex entirely, reaching the regulation centres directly without needing the child's conscious cooperation.

ASMR sounds provide intimacy without physical contact. Nature soundscapes offer consistent, predictable patterns the nervous system can settle into. Frequency-based sounds like solfeggio frequencies and binaural beats affect brainwave patterns and support regulation without requiring engagement.

The difference between overwhelming sound and calming sound isn't volume. It's predictability. It's control. It's the specific qualities of the sound itself.
