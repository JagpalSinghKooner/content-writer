# Instagram Content: Calming Sounds for Sensory Overload

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
Your child is in sensory overload.

Weighted blanket? Thrown off.
Fidget? Can't hold it.
Deep breathing? Can't hear you.

There's ONE thing that works.

### Slide 2: The Problem
Most calming tools ask something of your child.

Weighted blankets → need touch tolerance
Fidgets → need motor control
Deep pressure → need physical acceptance
Breathing → need coordination

Every single one requires something.

### Slide 3: Why Sound is Different
Sound requires NOTHING.

Your child doesn't need to:
✗ Reach for it
✗ Hold it
✗ Follow instructions
✗ Coordinate their body

The sound simply exists.
It enters without asking permission.

### Slide 4: The Science
Certain sound frequencies signal SAFETY to the nervous system.

Predictable patterns → Brain stops scanning for danger
Specific frequencies → "Rest and digest" mode
Passive input → Bypasses overwhelmed brain

### Slide 5: What Works
ASMR Sounds
Whispers, tapping, brushing
→ Intimacy without touch

Nature Sounds
Rain, ocean, forest
→ Predictable patterns

Frequencies
Solfeggio, binaural beats
→ Affects brainwaves directly

### Slide 6: Match to Your Child
Auditory Seekers:
White noise, pink noise, layered sounds

Auditory Sensitives:
Predictable sounds, controlled volume, simple layers

The difference isn't volume.
It's predictability and control.

### Slide 7: When to Use Sound
Not just for crisis moments.

Morning regulation
Transition support
Pre-sleep wind-down
Recovery after overload

Prevention > Intervention

### Slide 8: Zero-Demand Principle
Don't ask your child to:
• Choose what to play
• Put on headphones
• Tell you if it's helping
• Do anything except BE

The more you ask, the less it works.

### Slide 9: What Sound Cannot Do
Sound is powerful.
But it's one tool among many.

Sound cannot:
• Replace your calm presence
• Fix underlying differences
• Work immediately
• Be the only strategy

### Slide 10: Start Today
Press play when your child needs it.

That's all it takes.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

## Caption

Your child is in sensory overload. Crying. Shaking. Hands over ears.

You reach for the weighted blanket. They throw it off.

.
.
.

Here's what most parents don't realise: sound works when everything else fails. Your child can hear even when they can't process anything else. Sound reaches them without demanding anything back.

Weighted blankets need them to tolerate touch. Fidgets need motor control. Deep pressure needs them to accept physical contact. Breathing exercises need them to follow instructions.

Every single one requires something. Sound requires nothing.

Research on Polyvagal Theory shows that certain sound frequencies signal safety to the nervous system. Predictable patterns calm the brain. Specific frequencies activate the parasympathetic nervous system—the "rest and digest" mode.

Passive input bypasses the overwhelmed prefrontal cortex entirely. The auditory input reaches the regulation centres directly, without needing the child's conscious cooperation.

ASMR sounds, nature soundscapes, frequency-based audio—each provides a different entry point for the nervous system to settle.

The difference between overwhelming sound and calming sound isn't volume. It's predictability. It's control. It's the specific qualities of the sound itself.

Press play when your child needs it. That's all it takes. One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.
