# Instagram Content: Sensory Overload in Children - The Complete Guide

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
WHEN NOTHING ELSE WORKS

Sound isn't the enemy.
It's the solution.

### Slide 2: The Problem
You've tried everything:

✗ Weighted blankets
✗ Fidget spinners
✗ Ear defenders
✗ Calm corners

And still your child is in sensory overload.

### Slide 3: What We Get Wrong
Every piece of advice says:

"Reduce stimulation.
Block out noise.
Create silence."

But blocking sound doesn't help during crisis.

### Slide 4: Why Sound Works
Sound requires nothing from your child.

No touching.
No coordinating.
No effort.

Press play.
Step back.
Let it work.

### Slide 5: The Sound Paradox
"But my child is sound-sensitive!"

There's a difference between:

❌ Overwhelming noise (fire alarms, crowds)
✓ Therapeutic sound (ASMR, frequencies, nature)

One floods the system.
The other anchors it.

### Slide 6: Cumulative Overload
Most parents only see the final straw.

"It was just a normal question!"

Because it wasn't about the question.

Your child tolerated the whole day.
Then something small tipped them over.

### Slide 7: After-School Reset
The moment they walk through the door:

Don't ask about their day.
Don't offer snacks (yet).
Don't mention homework.

Play calming sounds.

Let the environment support regulation.

### Slide 8: The Recovery Phase
After overload passes, your child isn't finished.

Their nervous system needs recovery:

• Reduced demands
• Gentle sounds
• Hours, not minutes

Give them time.

### Slide 9: Daily Prevention
Build sound into regulation:

🌅 Morning: organising frequencies
🚗 Transitions: familiar sounds
🏠 After-school: ready before arrival
📚 Focus time: binaural beats
🌙 Bedtime: layered ambient

### Slide 10: The Complete Guide
Everything UK parents need to know about sensory overload.

Why it happens.
What actually helps.
How sound becomes the tool that works.

## Caption

When nothing else works for your overwhelmed child, sound becomes the solution.

.
.
.

You've tried the weighted blanket. It got thrown across the room.

The fidget spinners are somewhere under the sofa. The ear defenders lasted approximately forty-five seconds. And still your child is in sensory overload.

Here's what nobody tells you: sound isn't the enemy. It's the answer.

Every piece of advice focuses on reducing input. Block the noise. Create silence. But during crisis, silence doesn't give your child's flooded nervous system anything to hold onto.

Therapeutic sound does.

Sound is the only sensory tool that requires nothing. No touching. No coordinating. No engagement. Your child just receives. Press play. Step back. Let it work.

This isn't about all sound. It's about the right sound. Predictable frequencies that give the overwhelmed brain something safe to anchor to.

We've created a complete guide covering everything UK parents need to know about sensory overload in children. Why it happens. What actually helps. And how the right sound can become the regulation tool that works when everything else fails.

Because one quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Why doesn't anything work when my child is in sensory overload?"

[On screen: parent looking exhausted, child clearly overwhelmed in background]

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
"Because every tool you've been told to use requires something from them.

Weighted blankets need touch tolerance. Fidgets need coordination. Ear defenders need head pressure.

During overload, they can't do any of that.

But sound is different. Sound requires nothing. Just press play. Step back. Let it work."

[On screen: calm child with headphones/speaker nearby, parent visibly relieved]

**[20-30 seconds: CTA]**
"Not all sound. The right sound. Therapeutic frequencies that give their overwhelmed brain something safe to anchor to.

We've written a complete guide. Link in bio."

## Visual Notes

**Carousel design:**
- Warm, calming colour palette (soft blues, gentle greens, warm neutrals)
- Clean, high-contrast text
- Avoid overwhelming visual elements (ironic given the topic)
- Use parent-friendly, accessible fonts
- Include small sound wave graphics or frequency visualisations where relevant

**Reel B-roll suggestions:**
- Parent setting up calming sounds on phone/speaker
- Child visibly calming while listening (if showing children, ensure consent/stock footage)
- Visual representation of "before" (chaos) and "after" (calm)
- Close-up of pressing play button
- Gentle sound wave animations
- Soft, soothing transitions (no jarring cuts)
