# Newsletter Snippet: Sensory Diet for Children - The Missing System

## Hook

You've done everything the occupational therapist suggested. Heavy work. Swinging. Movement breaks. And it helps. Sometimes. But there's a sensory system missing from nearly every sensory diet for children. The one that regulates fastest.

## Body

Sound reaches your child's emotional centres in 12 milliseconds. That's faster than touch. Faster than movement. Faster than anything else you're doing.

Yet most sensory diets treat auditory input as noise to reduce, not as a regulation tool to add. Ear defenders, quiet spaces, noise-cancelling headphones. All valid. But that's only half the picture.

Here's what gets missed: therapeutic sound is completely different from environmental noise. Unpredictable noise overwhelms. Predictable, controlled sound regulates. Even sound-sensitive children can benefit from the right therapeutic sound because it gives their brain something stable to organise around.

For exhausted parents, sound is the easiest sensory input to provide. No swing to set up. No heavy work to supervise. Press play. That's it. For depleted children after a long day of masking, sound requires nothing. No touch tolerance. No motor control. Just ears. Just presence.

If your child's sensory diet isn't working as well as you'd hoped, try adding auditory input. Morning routine. After school. Homework time. Transitions. Bedtime. Give the auditory system the attention it deserves.
