# Instagram Content: Sensory Diet for Children - The Missing System

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
YOUR CHILD'S
SENSORY DIET
IS MISSING
A SYSTEM

(The one that regulates fastest)

### Slide 2: The Traditional Focus
Most sensory diets focus on:

✓ Heavy work
✓ Movement
✓ Touch

These work.

But there's a gap.

### Slide 3: The Missing System
AUDITORY INPUT

Sound reaches the brain's emotional centres in 12 milliseconds

Faster than touch
Faster than movement
Faster than anything else

### Slide 4: Why It Gets Missed
Most OTs address sound as noise to reduce:

• Ear defenders
• Quiet spaces
• Headphones

Valid. But only half the picture.

### Slide 5: The Truth
THERAPEUTIC SOUND ≠
ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE

Unpredictable noise → overwhelms

Predictable sound → regulates

Even sound-sensitive children can benefit.

### Slide 6: For Exhausted Parents
Sound is the easiest sensory input to provide:

No swing to set up
No heavy work to supervise

Press play. That's it.

### Slide 7: For Depleted Children
After a long day of masking, sound requires nothing:

No touch tolerance
No motor control
Just ears
Just presence

### Slide 8: When to Use Sound
• Morning routine
• School drop-off
• After school (reset first)
• Homework time
• Bedtime wind-down
• Post-meltdown recovery

### Slide 9: It Enhances Everything
Sound doesn't compete.
It complements.

Heavy work + sound = more regulating
Swinging + headphones = deeper calm
Quiet time + sound = more restful

### Slide 10: CTA
If your child's sensory diet isn't working as well as you'd hoped...

Try adding sound.

## Caption

Your child's sensory diet is missing the system that regulates fastest.

.
.
.

You've done everything the OT suggested. Heavy work. Swinging. Movement breaks. The whole checklist. And it helps. Sometimes. But not enough. Not consistently. Not when it really matters.

Here's what nobody told you: there's a sensory system missing from nearly every sensory diet. The one that regulates fastest. Auditory input.

Sound reaches your child's emotional centres in 12 milliseconds. That's faster than touch. Faster than movement. Faster than anything else you're doing. Yet most sensory diets treat sound as background noise, not as a regulation tool.

For exhausted parents, sound is the easiest sensory input to provide. No swing to set up. No heavy work to supervise. Press play. That's it. For depleted children after a long day of masking, sound requires nothing. No touch tolerance. No motor control. Just ears. Just presence.

If your child's sensory diet isn't working as well as you'd hoped, try adding auditory input. Morning routine. After school. Homework time. Transitions. Bedtime. Give the auditory system the attention it deserves.

The Open Sanctuary has sounds designed specifically for sensory regulation. Try one tonight and see what your child responds to.
