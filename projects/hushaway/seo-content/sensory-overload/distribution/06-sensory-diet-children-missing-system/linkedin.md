# LinkedIn Content: Sensory Diet for Children - The Missing System

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
You've done everything the OT suggested.

Heavy work. Swinging. Movement breaks. The whole checklist.

And it helps. Sometimes.

But there's a sensory system missing from nearly every sensory diet.

Swipe → to learn which one

### Slide 2: The Traditional Focus
Most sensory diets focus on three systems:

**Proprioception** (heavy work)
**Vestibular** (movement)
**Tactile** (touch)

These deserve attention. They work.

But there's a gap. A big one.

### Slide 3: The Missing System
**Auditory input.**

Sound reaches your child's amygdala in 12 milliseconds.

That's faster than touch.
Faster than movement.
Faster than anything else you're doing.

Yet most sensory diets ignore it completely.

### Slide 4: Why It Gets Overlooked
Most OTs address sound as noise to *reduce*.

Ear defenders. Quiet spaces. Noise-cancelling headphones.

All valid. But that's only half the picture.

Therapeutic sound ≠ environmental noise.

### Slide 5: The Difference
Unpredictable noise (fire alarms, crowded rooms):
Overwhelms

Predictable therapeutic sound (consistent volume, safe frequencies):
Regulates

Sound-sensitive children can benefit from the right sound.

### Slide 6: Why This Matters
For exhausted parents:
Sound is the easiest sensory input to provide.

No swing to set up.
No heavy work to supervise.
Just press play.

For depleted children:
Sound requires nothing but presence.

### Slide 7: When to Use Sound
• Morning routine (transition support)
• School drop-off (pre-regulation)
• After school (reset before anything else)
• Homework (focus support)
• Bedtime wind-down (nervous system shift)
• Post-meltdown recovery (low-demand regulation)

### Slide 8: It Enhances Everything
Sound doesn't compete with other sensory input.

It complements it.

Heavy work + calming frequencies = more regulating
Swinging + headphones = deeper calm
Quiet time + therapeutic sound = more restful

### Slide 9: The Complete Picture
A complete sensory diet addresses all seven systems.

Leaving out auditory input is like a nutritional diet without protein.

You can survive.
But you're not getting everything you need.

### Slide 10: CTA
If your child's sensory diet isn't working as well as you'd hoped, try adding sound.

Your child's sensory diet is missing a system.

And it's the one that regulates fastest.

Most sensory diets focus on three systems: proprioception (heavy work), vestibular (movement), and tactile (touch). These work. They deserve the attention they get.

But here's what gets missed: auditory input.

Sound reaches the amygdala in 12 milliseconds. That's faster than touch. Faster than movement. The auditory system has a direct line to the parts of the brain that control emotional state.

Yet most sensory diets treat sound as something to reduce, not something to add.

Here's why this matters:

**For exhausted parents:** Sound is the easiest sensory input to provide. No swing to set up. No heavy work to supervise. Press play. That's it.

**For depleted children:** After a long day of masking and filtering, sound requires nothing. No touch tolerance. No motor control. Just ears. Just presence.

**For regulation:** Therapeutic sound isn't environmental noise. Unpredictable noise overwhelms. Predictable, controlled sound regulates.

If your child's sensory diet isn't working as well as you'd hoped, try adding auditory input. Morning routine. After school. Homework time. Transitions. Bedtime.

The auditory system regulates faster than any other. Give it the attention it deserves.

The Open Sanctuary has sounds designed specifically for sensory regulation. Try one tonight and see what your child responds to.

Sound-sensitive children can still benefit from therapeutic sound.

This surprises most parents.

"My child covers their ears in busy places. Won't sound make it worse?"

No. Here's why:

**Environmental noise** (the kind that overwhelms):
• Unpredictable volume
• Sudden changes
• Uncontrolled frequencies
• No pattern to organise around

**Therapeutic sound** (the kind that regulates):
• Consistent volume
• No surprises
• Safe frequencies
• Predictable patterns

They're completely different experiences.

Many sound-sensitive children find the right therapeutic sound deeply calming. It gives their brain something stable to organise around in a chaotic sensory world.

The key is experimentation. Start with simple, soft frequencies. Low volume. Longer exposure. Observe how your child responds. Their nervous system will guide you.

For auditory seekers: richer, more layered sounds work well.
For auditory avoiders: simpler, softer sounds are better.

But "nothing" isn't the answer for either profile.

If you've been avoiding sound because your child is sound-sensitive, try therapeutic sound. You might be surprised by what happens.

The Open Sanctuary has sounds designed for different sensory profiles. Explore and see what fits.
