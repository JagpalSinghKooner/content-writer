# Twitter/X Content: Sensory Diet for Children - The Missing System

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your child's sensory diet is missing the system that regulates fastest.

Sound reaches the brain's emotional centres in 12 milliseconds.

Yet most sensory diets ignore auditory input completely.

Here's what you need to know 🧵

### Tweet 2
Traditional sensory diets focus on:

• Proprioception (heavy work)
• Vestibular (movement)
• Tactile (touch)

These work. They deserve attention.

But there's a gap. A big one.

### Tweet 3
The missing system: **Auditory input**

Sound reaches the amygdala in 12 milliseconds.

Faster than touch.
Faster than movement.
Faster than anything else you're doing.

### Tweet 4
Most OTs address sound as noise to *reduce*:

• Ear defenders
• Quiet spaces
• Noise-cancelling headphones

Valid. But that's only half the picture.

Therapeutic sound ≠ environmental noise.

### Tweet 5
The difference:

**Environmental noise** (overwhelms):
Unpredictable volume, sudden changes, no pattern

**Therapeutic sound** (regulates):
Consistent volume, no surprises, safe frequencies, predictable

Completely different experiences.

### Tweet 6
For exhausted parents: sound is the easiest sensory input to provide.

No swing to set up.
No heavy work to supervise.
Just press play.

That's it.

### Tweet 7
For depleted children: sound requires nothing.

No touch tolerance needed.
No motor control required.
Just ears. Just presence.

Perfect for after-school meltdowns when everything else is too much.

### Tweet 8
When to use auditory input:

• Morning routine (transition support)
• School drop-off (pre-regulation)
• After school (reset first)
• Homework (focus)
• Bedtime (wind-down)
• Post-meltdown (recovery)

### Tweet 9
Sound doesn't compete with other sensory activities.

It complements them:

Heavy work + sound = more regulating
Swinging + headphones = deeper calm
Quiet time + therapeutic sound = more restful

### Tweet 10
Different sensory profiles need different sounds:

**Auditory seekers:** Rich, layered soundscapes
**Auditory avoiders:** Simple, soft frequencies

But "nothing" isn't the answer for either.

Experimentation is key.

### Tweet 11
Sound-sensitive children can benefit from therapeutic sound.

Unpredictable noise overwhelms them.
Predictable therapeutic sound can regulate them.

Many find the right sound deeply calming because it gives their brain something stable to organise around.

### Tweet 12
A complete sensory diet addresses all seven systems.

Leaving out auditory input is like a nutritional diet without protein.

You can survive.
But you're not getting everything you need.

### Tweet 13 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Sound regulates in 12 milliseconds (fastest sensory system)
• Most sensory diets ignore auditory input
• Therapeutic sound ≠ environmental noise
• Easiest sensory input for exhausted parents
• Complements all other sensory activities

Try adding sound to your child's sensory diet.

The Open Sanctuary has sounds for sensory regulation. Link in bio.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Sound reaches your child's emotional centres in 12 milliseconds.

That's faster than touch. Faster than movement.

Yet most sensory diets ignore auditory input completely.

If your child's sensory diet isn't working as well as you'd hoped, this might be why.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

Sound-sensitive children need therapeutic sound more than anyone.

Not environmental noise. Therapeutic sound.

Predictable, controlled frequencies give their brain something stable to organise around in a chaotic sensory world.

### Tweet C (List)
5 moments to add sound to your child's sensory diet:

• Morning routine (transition support)
• After school (reset before demands)
• Homework (focus support)
• Bedtime (wind-down)
• Post-meltdown (recovery)

Sound requires nothing but presence. Perfect for depleted children.

### Tweet D (Parent Pain Point)
"We've done everything the OT suggested. It helps. Sometimes. But not consistently."

You're feeding six sensory systems and starving the one that regulates fastest.

Sound reaches the brain's emotional centres in 12 milliseconds.

Try adding auditory input.

### Tweet E (Proof)
For exhausted parents, sound is the easiest sensory input to provide.

No swing to set up.
No heavy work to supervise.
No touch tolerance required.

Press play. That's it.

The Open Sanctuary has sounds designed for sensory regulation.
