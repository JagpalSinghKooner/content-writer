# LinkedIn Content: Sensory Overload Recovery

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
The meltdown is over.

Your child is quiet now.

What do you do in the hours after?

Swipe → for the recovery phase no one talks about

### Slide 2: What's Actually Happening
After sensory overload, the nervous system doesn't just snap back.

Think of it like a storm. The rain has stopped, but the ground is still flooded.

Your child's nervous system is doing the same work.

### Slide 3: The Sensory Hangover
After overload, you might notice:

• Seems foggy or "not quite there"
• Can't handle even gentle requests
• Startles at small sounds
• Exhausted but can't sleep
• Has another meltdown hours later

These aren't new problems. They're signs the nervous system is still recovering.

### Slide 4: Why Traditional Advice Falls Short
"Talk about what happened."
"Discuss how to handle it next time."

This isn't wrong. It's just badly timed.

The thinking brain is still recovering. Asking them to reflect puts demands on a system with nothing left to give.

### Slide 5: What Helps Instead
Reduce demands to almost nothing.

Create space for the nervous system to recover without processing anything new.

This is where sound becomes a recovery tool that nothing else can match.

### Slide 6: Why Sound Works
The nervous system needs something that:

✓ Requires zero effort
✓ Provides predictable input
✓ Gives the brain something to anchor to
✓ Doesn't add demands

Sound fits every requirement. Press play. Step back.

### Slide 7: The First Hour
Protect and reduce demands.

Keep lights low. Reduce talking. Offer presence without interaction.

Press play on a gentle soundscape. No questions. No requests. Just something soft for their nervous system to land on.

### Slide 8: Recovery Isn't Crisis
We give all our attention to the meltdown.

But recovery is where the nervous system actually heals.

Skip it, rush it, or ignore it, and you're setting up the next overload.

### Slide 9: The Real Learning
The real learning from a meltdown doesn't happen in the conversation about it.

It happens in the thousands of quiet moments of feeling safe and regulated that follow.

Those moments build resilience.

### Slide 10: CTA
Recovery is part of the cycle.

Support it properly, and you're breaking the pattern.

The meltdown is over. Your child is quiet now. Maybe curled up in a corner. Maybe staring at nothing.

And you're left wondering: what do I do now?

Everyone talks about what to do during sensory overload. But what about the hours after?

This is where most advice stops. The crisis has passed, so we're supposed to move on. Return to normal. Get on with things.

But your child hasn't moved on. They're exhausted in a way that goes deeper than tired. Their nervous system just experienced a flood, and it needs time to rebuild.

Sensory overload recovery is real. It's not about bouncing back immediately. It's about understanding that the hours after a meltdown matter just as much as the meltdown itself.

Here's what's actually happening:

After the peak passes, the nervous system doesn't just snap back to normal. Think of it like a storm. The rain has stopped, but the ground is still flooded. The drains are still working to clear the water.

Your child's nervous system is doing the same work.

This is the sensory hangover. And if you've ever watched your child struggle for hours after a meltdown, wondering why they can't just "snap out of it," this is why.

What helps? Not more talking, not processing, not lessons.

What helps is reducing demands to almost nothing. Creating space for the nervous system to recover without having to process anything new.

Sound becomes a recovery tool here that nothing else can match. Press play on something gentle. No questions. No requests. Just something soft for their nervous system to land on whilst it repairs.

Recovery is where the nervous system actually heals. Skip it, rush it, or ignore it, and you're setting up the next overload.

Support it properly, and you're breaking the cycle.

What's your experience with post-meltdown recovery?

Here's something that catches many parents out after a meltdown:

Sometimes, your child seems suddenly calm. Peaceful even. Compliant in a way they rarely are.

You think: "Finally, they've settled."

But this calm can be a form of shutdown rather than genuine recovery.

The nervous system has exhausted itself and is now in a low-energy state that looks like peace but is actually depletion.

How to tell the difference?

Watch their responsiveness.

A child in genuine post-meltdown calm will gradually become more engaged, more themselves, as time passes.

A child in shutdown stays flat, disconnected, and may struggle to engage with anything, even things they usually enjoy.

If you're seeing shutdown, the recovery principles still apply: low demands, gentle sound, time.

Don't try to pull them out of it. Let the nervous system find its way back.

It will. It just needs the space to do so.

The quiet after a meltdown matters just as much as the meltdown itself. Treat it that way.

What signs of recovery do you notice in your child?
