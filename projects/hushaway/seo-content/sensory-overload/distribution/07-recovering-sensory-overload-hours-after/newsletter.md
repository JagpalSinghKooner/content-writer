# Newsletter Snippet: Sensory Overload Recovery

## Hook

The meltdown is over. Your child is quiet now. Maybe curled up in a corner. Maybe staring at nothing. And you're left wondering: what do I do now?

## Body

Everyone talks about what to do during sensory overload. But what about the hours after? This is where most advice stops. The crisis has passed, so we're supposed to move on, return to normal, get on with things.

But your child hasn't moved on. They're exhausted in a way that goes deeper than tired. Their nervous system just experienced a flood, and it needs time to rebuild. This is what we call the sensory hangover.

After the peak passes, the nervous system doesn't just snap back to normal. Think of it like a storm. The rain has stopped, but the ground is still flooded. The drains are still working to clear the water. Your child's nervous system is doing the same work.

What helps isn't more talking, processing, or lessons. What helps is reducing demands to almost nothing. Creating space for the nervous system to recover without having to process anything new. Sound becomes a recovery tool here that nothing else can match. Press play on something gentle. No questions. No requests. Just something soft for their nervous system to land on whilst it repairs.

Recovery is where the nervous system actually heals. Skip it, rush it, or ignore it, and you're setting up the next overload. Support it properly, and you're breaking the cycle.

## CTA

The quiet after a meltdown matters just as much as the meltdown itself.
