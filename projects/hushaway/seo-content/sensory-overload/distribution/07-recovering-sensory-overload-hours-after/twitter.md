# Twitter/X Content: Sensory Overload Recovery

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
The meltdown is over. Your child is quiet.

What do you do in the hours after? This is the recovery phase no one talks about.

🧵 Thread on sensory overload recovery:

### Tweet 2
Everyone talks about what to do DURING sensory overload.

But the hours after? That's where most advice stops.

Here's the thing: your child hasn't moved on. Their nervous system is still flooded.

### Tweet 3
1. What's actually happening

After sensory overload, the nervous system doesn't snap back to normal.

Think of it like a storm. The rain has stopped, but the ground is still flooded.

This is the sensory hangover.

### Tweet 4
2. What it looks like

After overload, your child might:

• Seem foggy or "not quite there"
• Can't handle gentle requests
• Startles at small sounds
• Exhausted but can't sleep
• Has another meltdown hours later

### Tweet 5
3. Why "talk about it" doesn't work

Traditional advice says: "Discuss what happened. Process feelings."

This isn't wrong. It's just badly timed.

The thinking brain is still recovering. You're asking them to run a marathon the day after they already ran one.

### Tweet 6
4. What helps instead

Reduce demands to almost nothing.

Create space for the nervous system to recover without processing anything new.

This is where sound becomes a recovery tool that nothing else can match.

### Tweet 7
5. Why sound works

During recovery, the nervous system needs something that:

✓ Requires zero effort
✓ Provides predictable input
✓ Gives the brain something to anchor to
✓ Doesn't add demands

Sound fits every requirement.

### Tweet 8
6. The first hour

Protect and reduce demands.

• Keep lights low
• Reduce talking
• Offer presence without interaction
• Press play on gentle sound

No questions. No requests. Just something soft for their nervous system to land on.

7. Recovery vs. shutdown

Sometimes after a meltdown, a child seems suddenly calm. Peaceful. Compliant.

That can be shutdown, not recovery.

Recovery: Gradually more engaged, more themselves
Shutdown: Flat, disconnected, struggling to engage

Both need low demands and time.

### Tweet 10
8. Why recovery matters

We give all our attention to the meltdown.

But recovery is where the nervous system actually heals.

Skip it, rush it, or ignore it, and you're setting up the next overload.

### Tweet 11 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Recovery takes hours, not minutes
• Reduce demands to almost nothing
• Sound provides gentle support
• Don't rush back to normal
• The quiet matters as much as the crisis

If this was useful:
1. Follow @[handle] for more sensory support
2. RT the first tweet

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
The real learning from a meltdown doesn't happen in the conversation about it.

It happens in the thousands of quiet moments of feeling safe and regulated that follow.

Those moments build resilience. The debrief is just icing.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

After a meltdown, your child doesn't need you to process, teach, or fix.

They need you to reduce demands to almost nothing and let their nervous system recover in peace.

The learning comes later. Recovery comes first.

### Tweet C (List)
5 signs your child is in sensory hangover (not just tired):

• Foggy, "not quite there"
• Can't handle gentle requests
• Startles at small sounds
• Exhausted but can't sleep
• Another meltdown hours later

This is nervous system recovery, not behaviour.

### Tweet D (Pattern)
Most post-meltdown advice:
"Talk about what happened"
"Discuss how to handle it next time"
"Help them name their feelings"

Reality:
The thinking brain is offline.

Try this instead:
Reduce demands. Offer gentle sound. Give them time.

Process later when they're regulated.

### Tweet E (Proof)
After sensory overload, sound becomes a recovery tool that nothing else can match.

Why? It requires zero effort, provides predictable input, and gives the brain something to anchor to whilst it repairs.

Press play. Step back. Let it work.
