# Instagram Content: Sensory Overload Recovery

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
The meltdown is over.

Now what?

[Bold text, high contrast - calming colour palette]

### Slide 2: The Problem
Everyone talks about what to do DURING sensory overload.

But the hours after? That's where most advice stops.

Your child hasn't moved on. Their nervous system is still flooded.

### Slide 3: What's Happening
After sensory overload, the nervous system doesn't snap back.

Think of it like a storm. The rain has stopped, but the ground is still flooded.

This is the sensory hangover.

### Slide 4: What It Looks Like
After overload, you might notice:

✗ Foggy or "not quite there"
✗ Can't handle gentle requests
✗ Startles at small sounds
✗ Exhausted but can't sleep
✗ Another meltdown hours later

### Slide 5: Why Talking Doesn't Work
"Discuss what happened"
"Process feelings"
"Name emotions"

This isn't wrong. It's just badly timed.

The thinking brain is still recovering.

### Slide 6: What Helps Instead
Reduce demands to almost nothing.

Create space for the nervous system to recover without processing anything new.

This is where sound helps.

### Slide 7: Why Sound Works
During recovery, the nervous system needs:

✓ Zero effort required
✓ Predictable input
✓ Something to anchor to
✓ No demands

Sound fits every requirement.

### Slide 8: The First Hour
Protect and reduce:

• Keep lights low
• Reduce talking
• Offer presence without interaction
• Press play on gentle sound

No questions. Just space.

### Slide 9: Recovery vs. Shutdown
Sudden calm after a meltdown?

Could be shutdown, not recovery.

Recovery: Gradually more engaged
Shutdown: Flat, disconnected

Both need low demands and time.

### Slide 10: CTA
Recovery is where the nervous system heals.

Skip it, and you're setting up the next overload.

Support it, and you're breaking the cycle.

## Caption

The meltdown is over. Your child is quiet now. And you're wondering: what do I do now?

.
.
.

Here's the thing everyone misses: the hours after sensory overload matter just as much as the meltdown itself.

After the peak passes, the nervous system doesn't just snap back to normal. Think of it like a storm. The rain has stopped, but the ground is still flooded. Your child's nervous system is still doing the work of recovery.

This is the sensory hangover. And if you've ever watched your child struggle for hours after a meltdown, wondering why they can't just "snap out of it," this is why.

What helps isn't more talking, processing, or lessons. What helps is reducing demands to almost nothing. Creating space for the nervous system to recover without having to process anything new.

Sound becomes a recovery tool here that nothing else can match. Press play on something gentle. No questions. No requests. Just something soft for their nervous system to land on whilst it repairs.

Recovery is where the nervous system actually heals. Skip it, rush it, or ignore it, and you're setting up the next overload. Support it properly, and you're breaking the cycle.

The quiet matters as much as the crisis. Treat it that way.
