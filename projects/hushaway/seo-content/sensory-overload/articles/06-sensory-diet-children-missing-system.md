You've done everything the occupational therapist suggested.

Heavy work. Swinging. Play-doh. Movement breaks. The whole sensory diet checklist.

And it helps. Sometimes. But not enough. Not consistently. Not when it really matters.

Here's what nobody told you: there's a sensory system missing from nearly every sensory diet for children. The one that actually regulates fastest.

Auditory input.

Sound reaches the emotional centres of your child's brain in 12 milliseconds. That's faster than touch. Faster than movement. Faster than anything else you're doing.

Yet most sensory diets treat sound as background noise, not as a regulation tool.

If your child's sensory diet isn't working as well as you'd hoped, this might be why. You're feeding six sensory systems and starving the one that could make the biggest difference.

## What Is a Sensory Diet?

Think of it like this: just like your body needs certain nutrients throughout the day, your child's nervous system needs certain sensory inputs.

A sensory diet is a personalised plan of sensory activities spread throughout the day to help your child stay regulated. The term comes from occupational therapy, and the concept is simple: some children need more sensory input than others. Some need specific types. By giving them the right input at the right times, you help prevent the build-up that leads to meltdowns, shutdowns, and sensory overload.

According to Understood.org, 2024: [What is a sensory diet?](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/sensory-diet), sensory diets are typically customised by occupational therapists and include activities targeting specific sensory systems.

Traditional sensory diets usually focus on three main systems:

**Proprioception (body awareness).** This is the "heavy work" system. Activities include pushing, pulling, carrying, lifting, climbing, and jumping. Proprioceptive activities are calming because they provide deep input to muscles and joints.

**Vestibular (movement and balance).** This is the movement system. Swinging, spinning, rocking, bouncing. Vestibular input can be alerting or calming depending on the type of movement.

**Tactile (touch).** This includes textures, temperatures, and pressure. Play-doh, sand, water play, brushing protocols, and weighted blankets all provide tactile input.

These three systems get most of the attention. And they deserve it.

But there's a gap. A big one.

## The Missing System: Auditory Input

Ask most occupational therapists about auditory input and you'll hear about reducing noise. Ear defenders. Quiet spaces. Noise-cancelling headphones.

All valid. But that's only half the picture.

Auditory input isn't just noise to manage. It's a regulation tool. For some children, it's the fastest route to calm.

Here's why: Sound signals reach the amygdala (the brain's alarm system) in as little as 12 milliseconds. That's faster than visual input. Faster than touch. The auditory system has a direct line to the parts of the brain that control our emotional state.

Research published in Frontiers in Neuroscience by Chanda & Levitin, 2013: [The neurochemistry of music](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00118/full), found that certain types of sound and music can reduce cortisol (the stress hormone) and increase dopamine. Predictable, rhythmic sound activates the parasympathetic nervous system, shifting the body from "fight or flight" to "rest and digest."

Yet most sensory diets treat auditory input as optional at best. Or they address it only as a problem (too much noise) rather than a solution (therapeutic sound).

This is the gap. And once you see it, you can't unsee it.

## Why Sound Gets Left Out of Sensory Diets

There are a few reasons auditory input gets overlooked.

**Many sensory-sensitive children are sound-sensitive.** Parents and therapists worry that adding sound will make things worse. But this misunderstands how therapeutic sound works. Unpredictable, uncontrolled noise (fire alarms, crowded rooms, sudden sounds) overwhelms. Predictable, controlled sound (consistent volume, safe frequencies, no surprises) regulates. They're not the same thing at all.

**Sound is harder to "prescribe."** You can hand someone a weighted blanket. You can't hand someone a sound. Therapists default to tools they can physically provide. Sound feels intangible, so it gets skipped.

**Traditional OT training emphasises tactile and proprioceptive input.** These are the foundations of sensory integration theory. Auditory processing tends to get specialised treatment rather than integrated into daily sensory diets.

The result? A sensory diet for children that feeds proprioception, vestibular, and tactile systems while ignoring the system that regulates fastest.

That changes today.

## How to Add Auditory Input to Your Child's Sensory Diet

Adding sound to your child's sensory diet doesn't require special equipment or therapist supervision. It requires understanding when and how to use sound for regulation.

Here's how to structure auditory input throughout the day:

### Morning Regulation

You know mornings. The negotiations. The frozen moments. The "we're going to be late" panic that makes everything worse.

Mornings are hard for many neurodivergent children. The transition from sleep to waking, from home to school, from pyjamas to clothes. Each transition is a potential overwhelm point.

**What works:** Calm, predictable sound during the morning routine. Soft frequencies or gentle ASMR playing in the background as your child gets dressed, eats breakfast, and prepares to leave. The sound provides an auditory anchor. Something stable in a sea of demands.

**What to avoid:** Radio with unpredictable adverts. Morning TV with loud jingles. These add auditory chaos to an already challenging transition.

### School Drop-off Reset

The car journey to school is often silent or filled with anxious chatter. Consider using it as auditory regulation time.

**What works:** Playing calming soundscapes during the drive. Frequencies designed for settling. This gives your child's nervous system something to organise around before the sensory onslaught of school.

**Why it matters:** A child who arrives at school already regulated has more capacity to handle the day. A child who arrives already depleted has less margin for error.

### After-School Sound Intervention

This is the moment many parents dread.

The hours after school are peak meltdown time. Your child has spent all day masking, holding it together, filtering sensory input. When they get home, the dam breaks.

As we explain in our [sensory overload guide](/understanding-sensory-overload-children), this "restraint collapse" is the nervous system releasing what it's been containing all day.

**What works:** Sound first. Before questions. Before snacks. Before screen time. Put on calming sounds the moment they walk through the door. Give their nervous system something regulating before asking anything of them.

This is where therapeutic sound shines. Weighted blankets require touch tolerance (often low after school). Fidgets require motor control (depleted). Sound requires nothing. Just ears. Just presence. Just press play.

For specific recommendations on which sounds work best, see our guide to [calming sounds for sensory overload](/guide-calming-sounds-sensory-overload).

### Homework and Focus Time

Fidgets. Movement breaks. Timers. Rewards. You've tried them all.

If your child still struggles to focus on homework, try sound.

**What works:** Consistent, predictable sound during focus activities. Binaural beats designed for concentration. Soft frequencies without lyrics or sudden changes. The sound gives the brain something to "lock onto," reducing the distraction of environmental noise.

**What to avoid:** Music with lyrics (activates language processing). Songs they know (triggers singing along). Variable volumes or tempos (disrupts focus).

### Transition Support

Transitions are sensory events. Stopping one activity. Starting another. Changing location, expectation, or demand. For many neurodivergent children, transitions are where regulation falls apart.

**What works:** Using sound as a transition signal. Not a jarring bell or alarm, but a gentle audio cue that indicates "we're moving to the next thing." Over time, this sound becomes associated with transition, reducing the anxiety of the unknown.

Some families use a specific piece of music for specific transitions. The same track for "time to start bedtime routine" every night. The predictability reduces resistance.

### Bedtime Wind-down

Sleep onset is a sensory regulation challenge. The brain needs to shift from alert to drowsy. For children with sensory processing differences, this shift doesn't happen automatically.

**What works:** A dedicated wind-down sound routine. 30-45 minutes of calming frequencies or sleep stories before bed. This isn't about "making them sleepy." It's about giving the nervous system the input it needs to transition to a sleep-ready state.

Consistency matters here. The same sounds, at the same time, in the same environment. The brain learns to associate these sounds with "time to shift down."

### Post-Meltdown Recovery

After a meltdown, your child is exhausted. You're exhausted. Everyone needs to recover.

Their nervous system has been through a storm. Recovery matters, and it's often overlooked in the rush to move on.

**What works:** Low-demand sound during the recovery period. Gentle frequencies that don't require attention or response. Let the sound do the regulating while your child rests.

For more on this, see our guide to [recovering from sensory overload](/recovering-sensory-overload-hours-after).

## Sensory Activities That Work Better With Sound

Here's the best part: you don't have to choose between traditional sensory activities and auditory input. Sound enhances other sensory diet activities.

**Proprioceptive activities + sound:** Heavy work is calming. Heavy work with calming frequencies playing is more calming. The dual input accelerates regulation.

**Vestibular activities + sound:** Swinging with headphones playing soft sounds adds an auditory component to vestibular input. The combination can be deeply regulating.

**Quiet time + sound:** "Quiet time" doesn't have to mean silence. Therapeutic sound during rest periods gives the brain something to organise around, which can actually make rest more restful.

**Sensory breaks + sound:** When your child needs a break from demands, sound can fill that space without adding any demands of its own. Unlike reading, puzzles, or even fidgets, sound asks nothing of your child except to be present.

## Matching Sounds to Sensory Profiles

Not all sounds work for all children. What calms one child might overwhelm another. Matching auditory input to your child's sensory profile matters.

**For auditory seekers (children who love sound):** Rich, layered soundscapes. ASMR with multiple textures. Frequencies with harmonic complexity. These children may need "more" to feel regulated.

**For auditory avoiders (children who are sound-sensitive):** Simple, consistent sounds. Single frequencies. Soft ASMR without sudden changes. Lower volume, longer exposure. For these children, less is more. But "nothing" isn't the answer either.

**For children who fluctuate:** Some days your child craves sound. Other days everything is too loud. Build flexibility into the sensory diet. Have options available for different states.

The key is experimentation. Start with low-demand sounds (simple frequencies, nature sounds) and observe how your child responds. Their nervous system will tell you what works. Trust it.

## Building a Complete Sensory Diet for Children

A complete sensory diet addresses all seven sensory systems. Here's how sound fits alongside the traditional systems:

| Time of Day | Proprioceptive | Vestibular | Tactile | Auditory |
|-------------|----------------|------------|---------|----------|
| Morning | Carry bag to car | Rocking while eating | Brushing hair with deep pressure | Calm frequencies during routine |
| School drop-off | - | - | - | Regulating soundscape in car |
| After school | Wall push-ups | Bouncing on trampoline | Weighted blanket | Sound first, before anything else |
| Homework | Chair push-ups | Movement break | Fidget | Binaural beats for focus |
| Transitions | Carrying items to next activity | - | - | Transition sound cue |
| Bedtime | Tight hugs | Gentle rocking | Deep pressure massage | Wind-down frequencies |
| Post-meltdown | - | - | Weighted blanket | Recovery sounds |

Notice that auditory input isn't competing with other systems. It's complementing them. Sound becomes the thread that runs through the day, providing consistent regulation support.

## Why This Matters for Your Child

Sensory diets work best when they address your child's complete sensory profile. Leaving out auditory input is like a nutritional diet without protein. You can survive. But you're not getting everything you need.

The auditory system regulates faster than any other sensory system. It requires zero effort from your child. It can be used anywhere, any time, with nothing more than a phone and headphones.

For exhausted parents of neurodivergent children, sound is also the easiest sensory input to provide. You don't have to set up a swing. You don't have to supervise heavy work. You press play. That's it.

If your child's current sensory diet isn't working as well as you'd hoped, try adding sound. Morning, afternoon, evening, transitions, bedtime. Give the auditory system the attention it deserves.

You might find it's been the missing piece all along.

The Open Sanctuary has sounds designed specifically for sensory regulation. Frequencies for calming. ASMR for focus. Sleep sounds for bedtime wind-down. Start there, see what your child responds to, and build from there.

## FAQ

### What is a sensory diet for children?

A sensory diet is a personalised schedule of sensory activities throughout the day designed to help a child stay regulated. It typically includes proprioceptive activities (heavy work like carrying and pushing), vestibular activities (movement like swinging and bouncing), and tactile activities (touch experiences like play-doh and weighted blankets). The goal is to give your child's nervous system the sensory input it needs to function well, preventing the build-up that leads to meltdowns and overwhelm.

### Why is auditory input missing from most sensory diets?

Most sensory diets focus on proprioceptive, vestibular, and tactile input because these are the foundations of traditional occupational therapy training. Sound is often addressed as something to reduce (ear defenders, quiet spaces) rather than as a regulation tool to add. Many therapists and parents also worry that adding sound will overwhelm sound-sensitive children, but therapeutic sound is different from overwhelming environmental noise.

### How do I know which sounds will help my child?

Start with simple, consistent sounds at low volume. Nature sounds, soft frequencies, and gentle ASMR are usually good starting points. Observe how your child responds. Do they seem calmer? More settled? Or more agitated? Their nervous system will guide you. Auditory seekers often respond to richer, more layered sounds. Auditory avoiders typically prefer simpler, softer sounds.

### Can I use sound for a child who is sound-sensitive?

Yes. Sound sensitivity doesn't mean all sound is bad. It means unpredictable, uncontrolled sound is overwhelming. Therapeutic sound is designed differently: consistent volume, no surprises, safe frequencies, predictable patterns. Many sound-sensitive children find the right therapeutic sound deeply calming because it gives their brain something stable to organise around.

### How often should auditory input be part of my child's sensory diet?

Daily. Just like proprioceptive and vestibular input, auditory input should be woven throughout the day. Key moments include morning routine (transition support), after school (reset), homework time (focus), transitions between activities (predictability), and bedtime (wind-down). The goal is consistent support, not just crisis intervention. One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.
