Your child covers their ears at fire alarms, hand dryers, balloons popping. Crowds are unbearable. Birthday parties end in tears before the cake is even cut.

You've spent months (maybe years) protecting them from sound. Leaving early. Avoiding places. Carrying ear defenders everywhere you go.

And now someone is telling you that sound could actually help them?

We get it. That feels impossible. Maybe even cruel.

If you have a child with auditory hypersensitivity, the idea of using sound to calm them seems completely backwards. Every instinct screams: protect them from noise. Block it out. Find silence.

But here's what we've learned from years of working with sound-sensitive children: there's a world of difference between noise that overwhelms and sound that regulates. Your child doesn't need silence. They need the right sound.

This isn't about exposing them to more of what hurts. It's about understanding why certain sounds trigger distress while others, designed specifically for sensitive ears, can bring genuine calm.

## What Auditory Hypersensitivity Actually Means

When a child has auditory hypersensitivity, their brain processes sound differently than neurotypical children. Sounds that others barely notice land at full volume. Every. Single. Time.

The school bell isn't just loud to your child. It's painful.

The hum of the refrigerator isn't background noise. It's constant, inescapable input that demands attention. And they can't tune it out the way you can.

According to the National Autistic Society, 2024: [Sensory differences](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/sensory-differences/sensory-differences/all-audiences), many autistic people experience hypersensitivity to sounds. This can make everyday environments feel overwhelming, unpredictable, and exhausting.

If you've read our guide on [understanding sensory overload](/sensory-overload/articles/01-understanding-sensory-overload-children), you'll know this isn't a choice or a behaviour problem. It's neurological. The filtering system that typically dampens irrelevant sounds doesn't work the same way in children with auditory hypersensitivity.

Every sound comes through at equal importance. Every sound demands processing. And eventually, the brain simply runs out of capacity.

That's when the meltdowns happen. Not because your child is being difficult. Because their system is flooded.

## Why Loud Noises Affect Autistic and Neurodivergent Children Differently

Research confirms what you already know from living it. Thye et al., 2018: [The impact of atypical sensory processing on social impairments in autism spectrum disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6879775/) found that sensory processing differences in autistic children affect how they respond to their environment at a fundamental neurological level.

For children experiencing loud noises, autism adds another layer of complexity. Here's the thing most people miss: the unpredictability of sound matters as much as the volume.

Think about what happens when a child with sound sensitivity encounters:

**Unpredictable sounds:** Fire alarms. Dogs barking. Car horns. Balloons popping. These sounds arrive without warning, at random volumes, with no pattern the nervous system can anticipate.

**Chaotic sounds:** Shopping centres. School assemblies. Birthday parties. Multiple overlapping noises competing for attention, none of them controllable.

**Sudden changes:** Someone laughing loudly. A door slamming. A baby crying in the next room. The nervous system is constantly jolted into high alert.

Now compare this to:

**Predictable sounds:** A consistent rhythm. A steady frequency. A pattern that continues without sudden changes.

**Controlled sounds:** Defined volume. Set duration. The child knows it won't suddenly spike or change.

**Designed sounds:** Created specifically for sensitive ears. No harsh frequencies. No jarring transitions. Built to feel safe.

The difference isn't just about whether sound is present. It's about what kind of sound. And that distinction changes everything.

## The Paradox Parents Need to Understand

This is where it gets counterintuitive. Stay with us.

Your sound-sensitive child isn't reacting to sound itself. They're reacting to unpredictable, uncontrollable, overwhelming sound.

Ear defenders block all sound. Sometimes that's exactly what's needed. When you're in a loud environment with no escape, blocking input is the right choice.

But ear defenders don't regulate the nervous system. They remove input. And absence isn't the same as presence.

Think about it. When your child comes home from school, their nervous system has been in survival mode for hours. Six hours of fight or flight. Constant alertness. Hypervigilance. They need something to actively bring them down from that state, not just the removal of triggers.

This is where therapeutic sound comes in.

ASMR, solfeggio frequencies, and carefully designed soundscapes give the nervous system something predictable to anchor to. Research from Poerio et al., 2018: [More than a feeling: Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is characterized by reliable changes in affect and physiology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31126256/) showed that ASMR produces measurable physiological responses, including reduced heart rate and increased skin conductance levels associated with emotional engagement.

In simple terms: certain sounds actively calm the body. Not by being absent, but by being present in exactly the right way.

Our guide on [calming sounds for sensory overload](/sensory-overload/articles/02-calming-sounds-sensory-overload) explains the science behind this in more detail. But for now, here's what matters: this isn't theory. Parents use this every day.

## Therapeutic Sound vs Triggering Noise: What's Different

Not all sound is created equal. Once you understand the difference, everything clicks into place.

**Triggering noise has these characteristics:**

- Unpredictable timing (you can't prepare for it)
- Variable volume (suddenly louder or quieter)
- Harsh frequencies (high-pitched, sharp, metallic)
- Overlapping sources (multiple sounds competing)
- No end point (you don't know when it will stop)

**Therapeutic sound has these characteristics:**

- Predictable pattern (the nervous system can relax into it)
- Consistent volume (no sudden spikes)
- Safe frequencies (designed for sensitive ears)
- Single, clear source (nothing competing for attention)
- Defined duration or gentle loop (certainty about what's coming)

When you understand this distinction, playing sounds for a sound-sensitive child stops feeling contradictory. You're not adding more noise. You're replacing chaos with pattern. Overwhelm with calm.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Let's say your child comes home from school completely overwhelmed. They've held it together all day. Masked all day. Now they're melting down at home because it's the only place safe enough to release.

Sound familiar?

**Option A: Remove all sound.** Turn everything off. Create silence. Hope they calm down eventually.

This can work. Sometimes they need the absence of stimulation. But if their nervous system is stuck in high alert, silence alone won't bring them down. They're still activated with nothing to anchor to. Just sitting in their own internal chaos.

**Option B: Offer therapeutic sound.** Press play on something designed for sensitive ears. A predictable soundscape. A frequency that signals safety. Something that asks nothing of them.

The sound gives their nervous system a focal point. Something consistent to land on while everything else feels chaotic inside.

You're not forcing sound on them. You're offering a different kind of sound. One designed for exactly this moment. One that does the regulating for them.

## Addressing the "But My Child Hates Sound" Objection

We hear this all the time. Parents who've watched their children cover their ears so many times they can't imagine sound ever being helpful.

Here's the truth: your child doesn't hate sound. They hate the sounds that overwhelm them. Big difference.

Watch closely. You'll notice they have sounds they tolerate. Maybe even sounds they actively seek out. The same child who screams at hand dryers might hum to themselves constantly. The same child who covers their ears at parties might watch the same video clip fifteen times in a row, specifically for its sound.

Children with auditory hypersensitivity often self-regulate with sound already. They just need the right sounds made accessible. That's where we come in.

Therapeutic sound designed for neurodivergent children is different from the random sounds of daily life. It's built from the ground up to be safe for sensitive ears. No sudden changes. No harsh frequencies. No unpredictable elements. Just sound that feels safe.

This isn't about desensitisation or exposure therapy. Not even close. It's about providing a tool that works with their nervous system instead of against it.

## How to Introduce Sound to a Sound-Sensitive Child

Start small. Don't announce it. Don't make it a big deal.

**Choose the right moment.** Not during peak overload. Try a calmer moment when they're slightly unsettled but still able to process. After school, before homework. That window often works.

**Control the environment.** Play it from a speaker across the room, not headphones. Let them move towards or away from it as they choose. Give them control.

**Keep the volume low.** Lower than you think necessary. A sound-sensitive child will hear it even when it feels barely audible to you. Trust that.

**Don't require anything.** Don't ask them to listen. Don't ask if they like it. Just let the sound exist in the space. Background. No pressure.

**Watch for response.** Some children gravitate towards it immediately. Others need several exposures before they connect it with feeling calm. Some will prefer certain types of sound over others. All normal.

The goal isn't to convince them to listen. It's to make therapeutic sound available when they need it. You're planting a seed, not forcing a flower.

## When Sound Won't Help (and That's Okay)

Let's be honest. Therapeutic sound isn't a magic fix for every moment of auditory hypersensitivity.

During peak meltdown, some children need complete silence. Their nervous system is so overwhelmed that even safe sound adds input they can't process. In these moments, ear defenders or a dark, quiet room might be exactly right. We're not here to tell you otherwise.

The point isn't that sound replaces all other strategies. It's that sound is a tool most parents never try because they assume all sound is harmful for their sound-sensitive child. That assumption often isn't true.

Sound works best:

- After school, as a reset before homework or dinner
- During transitions, to provide predictable input during change
- Before bed, to wind down an overactive nervous system
- During recovery, after a meltdown has peaked and they're starting to regulate

Sound might not work during:

- Peak crisis, when any input is too much
- Highly stimulating environments, where it would add to the chaos
- Moments when they specifically request silence

Your child will show you what they need. The key is having therapeutic sound available as an option.

## The Right Sound Isn't Just Quieter Sound

Some parents try playing gentle music or nature sounds and wonder why it doesn't help. "I tried that. It made things worse."

We hear this often. And usually, it's because even those sounds have unpredictable elements.

A rain soundtrack might seem calming. But if it includes sudden thunder or birds chirping at random intervals, a sound-sensitive child's nervous system stays on alert. Waiting. Bracing for the next unpredictable element.

Sound designed for neurodivergent children considers every detail:

- No sudden volume changes
- No unexpected frequencies appearing mid-track
- Predictable patterns the brain can anticipate
- Frequencies chosen for their regulating properties
- Consistent enough to be background, engaging enough to anchor attention

This is why generic "calming sounds" often don't work for children with auditory hypersensitivity. Their ears detect every variation, every inconsistency, every moment of unpredictability that neurotypical listeners filter out without even noticing.

They need sound specifically designed for how they hear. Not adapted from something else. Built for them.

## Finding What Works for Your Child

Every child with auditory hypersensitivity is different. Some prefer:

- Nature sounds without wildlife (steady rain, ocean waves)
- ASMR with gentle, consistent sounds
- Frequencies like solfeggio tones
- Ambient soundscapes with no variation

Others find certain sounds triggering that work perfectly for other children. This is completely normal. Finding what works takes a bit of exploration.

The Open Sanctuary offers sounds designed specifically for sensitive and neurodivergent children. No harsh frequencies. No sudden changes. Just predictable, regulating audio you can explore to find what clicks for your child. Press play, see what happens.

Start with one sound type. Notice how your child responds. Try it at different times of day. Be patient with the process. Give it a few tries before deciding.

The child who covers their ears at fire alarms might become the child who asks for "their calm sound" after school. We've seen it happen more often than you'd expect.

## FAQ

### Can sound therapy help auditory processing disorder?

Auditory processing disorder and auditory hypersensitivity are related but different. Both involve how the brain processes sound. Therapeutic sound won't cure auditory processing disorder, but it can provide a regulating input that helps the nervous system feel safer and calmer, which may support better processing in other areas.

### Why does my child with autism hate loud noises but seek other sounds?

This is common and makes perfect sense once you understand the difference between unpredictable and controlled sound. Your child might hate sudden, chaotic noises (loud noises autism triggers) while seeking specific sounds they control, like humming, clicking, or watching the same video repeatedly. They're self-regulating with sound already. Therapeutic sound taps into this same mechanism.

### Should I use ear defenders or calming sounds?

Both have their place. Ear defenders are excellent for environments you can't control, like crowded shops or school assemblies. Calming sounds work better for active regulation, like coming down after school or settling before bed. Blocking sound removes input. Therapeutic sound provides regulating input. Different tools for different needs.

### How do I know if my child has auditory hypersensitivity?

Signs include covering ears at sounds others tolerate, distress at unexpected noises, difficulty in noisy environments, commenting on sounds others don't notice, and strong preferences or aversions to specific sounds. If everyday sounds consistently cause distress, discussing sensory processing differences with your GP or a specialist can help clarify what's happening.

### Will playing sounds make my sound-sensitive child worse?

Not if you're using therapeutic sound designed for sensitive ears. The goal isn't to overwhelm them with more input. It's to provide predictable, controlled sound that gives their nervous system something safe to anchor to. Always start with low volume, never force it, and let your child guide what works for them.
