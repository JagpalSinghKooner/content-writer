## Executive Summary

### Top Opportunities

1. **ADHD Sleep** — 73-85% of ADHD children have sleep problems, yet no UK content exists that's ADHD-specific AND offers passive solutions. Parents search "ADHD sleep problems" desperately with few good resources. HushAway's passive listening approach directly addresses the "racing ADHD brain that won't switch off."

2. **Autistic Meltdowns** — Crisis-intent searches from parents mid-meltdown or trying to prevent the next one. Existing content is clinical and advice-heavy. HushAway can own "what to play during a meltdown" — immediate, practical, zero-effort.

3. **Sensory Overload in Children** — Core concern linking all ND challenges. Parents search for calming solutions but find product lists, not sound-based approaches. HushAway's frequency-based sounds and ASMR directly address sensory dysregulation.

4. **Calming Sounds for Children** — Direct product category with commercial intent. Current results dominated by YouTube playlists and generic meditation apps. HushAway can differentiate with ND-first design and passive listening.

### Quick Wins (3-Month Potential)

- **"ADHD child won't sleep"** — Desperate parent search, thin content, immediate product-solution fit
- **"Calming sounds for autistic child"** — Direct product match, low competition in UK
- **"Sensory overload after school"** — Specific use-case HushAway directly solves
- **"Meltdown recovery"** — No good content exists for post-meltdown calm

### Long-Term Plays (6-12 Months)

- **"Sound therapy for children"** — Requires authority building, positions HushAway as expert
- **"Best calming app for kids"** — Comparison content, needs brand recognition first
- **"Neurodivergent bedtime routine"** — Comprehensive guide competing with NHS/charity content

### Start Here

**First content piece: "ADHD Sleep Problems: What Actually Helps When Your Child's Brain Won't Switch Off"**

Why: Massive search volume (parents of 3-6% of UK school children with ADHD), high conversion intent (desperate for solutions), thin competition (existing content is clinical or generic), and perfect product-market fit (passive listening for racing brains).

| ✅ Complete | All articles written, validated, and distributed |

### Execution Order Rationale

1. **ADHD Sleep** — Highest opportunity: 73-85% of ADHD kids struggle, desperate parents with no good UK content. HushAway's passive listening directly solves "racing brain." Fast win with massive audience.

2. **Autistic Meltdowns** — Crisis intent converts: Parents search mid-meltdown. "Press play" solution is immediate. Builds authority in core ND space.

3. **Sensory Overload** — Foundation pillar: Connects ADHD, autism, and sensitive children. Explains WHY sound works. Links to all product use cases.

4. **Calming Sounds** — Commercial capture: After pillars 1-3 establish need, this pillar captures "what sounds" searches. Direct product match.

5-8. **Medium/Strategic pillars** — Build after core 4 established. Authority content (sound therapy), practical content (routines), conversion content (comparisons).

---

## Content Gaps Identified

Based on research, these gaps represent HushAway's greatest opportunities:

### Gap 1: ADHD-Specific Sound Guidance
**What's missing:** No UK content explains why generic sleep sounds don't work for ADHD brains, or what types of sounds actually help.
**HushAway opportunity:** Create the definitive "ADHD Sleep Sounds" content with scientific backing.

### Gap 2: "What to Play During a Meltdown"
**What's missing:** Meltdown content is advice-heavy ("reduce demands," "create calm space") but never says "play THIS sound."
**HushAway opportunity:** Immediate, actionable content with specific sound recommendations.

### Gap 3: Passive Listening Content
**What's missing:** All competitor content assumes interaction. Nothing addresses exhausted parents who need "just press play."
**HushAway opportunity:** Position passive listening as the differentiator throughout all content.

### Gap 4: UK-Specific ND Parenting
**What's missing:** Most content is US-based (CHADD, ADDitude). UK parents searching for local resources find NHS (clinical) or charities (generic).
**HushAway opportunity:** UK voice, UK English, UK context in every article.

### Gap 5: Sound-First Approach
**What's missing:** Calming content mentions weighted blankets, fidget toys, calm corners—rarely positions sound as primary tool.
**HushAway opportunity:** Be THE authority on sound-based calming for children.

## Keywords Not Worth Pursuing

| Keyword | Monthly Volume | Why Skip |
|---------|----------------|----------|

| "ADHD" (standalone) | 80,000+ | Too broad, clinical competition |
| "meditation for kids" | 5,000+ | Mainstream competition, not ND-specific |
| "sleep training" | 4,000+ | Different audience (neurotypical infants) |
| "white noise machine" | 3,000+ | Product search, Amazon dominates |
| "music therapy" | 2,000+ | Clinical term, therapist searches |
