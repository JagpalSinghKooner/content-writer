You've got a bedtime routine. Bath at 7pm. Teeth brushed by 7:15. Story time at 7:30. Lights out at 8.

And by 9:30, your child is still awake. Racing thoughts. Endless questions. Getting up for water. Finding every possible reason to leave their room.

The frustrating part? You're doing everything "right." You've followed all the advice. Consistent timing. Predictable sequence. Screen-free wind-down.

So why doesn't your ADHD bedtime routine work?

Here's what took us years to understand: the problem isn't that you need MORE routine. The problem is that standard routines are designed for neurotypical brains. They focus on what happens around your child but completely ignore what's happening inside their brain.

## Why Standard Bedtime Routines Fail ADHD Children

Every sleep guide gives the same advice: establish a consistent bedtime routine. Bath, story, lights out. Same time every night.

This works beautifully for neurotypical children. Their brains take those environmental cues and naturally wind down. The routine signals "sleep is coming" and the brain responds.

ADHD brains don't follow that script.

Research published in PubMed Central, 2025 — [Facilitating sleep initiation in children with ADHD and sleep problems](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12330042/) found that children with ADHD specifically identified "the importance of individualised approaches" to bedtime. One-size-fits-all routines consistently failed them.

The children in this study described a critical insight: they needed "a balance between activity and rest" and environmental factors that worked for their specific brain. Generic routines missed this entirely.

Here's why this matters: an ADHD child can complete every single step of a routine perfectly and still lie awake for hours. Because the routine addressed the external environment but did nothing for the internal one.

## The Missing Piece: What Routines Leave Out

Most bedtime routines focus on removing things. No screens. No active play. No stimulation.

For neurotypical children, this works. Remove the stimulation and the brain naturally quiets.

For ADHD children, it creates a vacuum.

We've written about [why your ADHD child won't sleep](articles/01-adhd-child-wont-sleep.md) and the core issue is this: the ADHD brain doesn't have an "off switch" for thoughts. When you remove external stimulation, the internal stimulation ramps up. Racing thoughts. Random ideas. Worries. That song stuck on repeat.

The quieter you make the room, the louder their brain becomes.

According to the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, 2023 — [The impact of sleep difficulties in children with ADHD on the family](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10545997/), children with ADHD experience "anxiety, fears, and overthinking" at bedtime. Parents in this study described bedtime as "hostile ground" they came to dread.

One parent put it perfectly: "Bedtime becomes hostile ground, doesn't it? It's the time that you come to dread because you know, it's like, 'here we go again.'"

Sound familiar?

The routine isn't failing because you're not consistent enough. It's failing because it's missing the one thing ADHD brains need: something to give racing thoughts somewhere to go.

## Building an ADHD Bedtime Routine That Works

An effective ADHD bedtime routine needs the same structure as a neurotypical routine — consistency matters even more for ADHD children — but with one addition: something that occupies the racing brain.

The DISCA Study (University of Southampton), 2024 — [Digital Intervention for Sleep in Children with ADHD](https://www.discasleep.org.uk/for-professionals) identified this gap in current guidance. They note that "professionals rarely receive training in sleep" and often resort to melatonin as a "one-size-fits-all" approach. But melatonin makes you feel sleepy — it doesn't address the brain that stays active despite feeling tired.

The children who sleep well have routines that include calming INPUT, not just the removal of stimulating input.

### The ADHD-Friendly Routine Structure

Here's a bedtime routine that actually works for ADHD brains. Notice what's different from the standard advice:

**6:30pm — Physical wind-down**

Some gentle movement. Nothing intense, but enough to let the body release energy. A walk around the garden. Stretching. Dancing to one favourite song. The Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, 2024 — [Understanding ADHD & Sleep](https://www.derbyshirehealthcareft.nhs.uk/application/files/2416/1157/8122/Sleep_Infromation__Advice_v2.pdf) recommends "gentle exercise late afternoon" like walking, trampoline, or dancing.

**7:00pm — Bath or shower**

Warm water helps lower core body temperature afterward, which signals sleep to the body. This step stays the same as standard advice.

**7:20pm — Teeth and pyjamas**

Keep this predictable. Same order every night. ADHD brains struggle with transitions, so consistent sequences reduce resistance.

**7:30pm — Quiet connection**

This is where most routines stop. Story time, then lights out.

But for ADHD children, this is where the work actually begins. Their brain is about to be left alone with nothing to do — and it will find something to do, usually racing thoughts.

**7:45pm — The missing piece: Passive sound**

This is what standard routines leave out.

Before lights out, give the brain something calming to focus on. Not something that requires engagement (that increases alertness). Passive sound — frequencies, gentle ambient audio, or soft soundscapes — gives racing thoughts somewhere to land.

The brain that was hunting for stimulation now has it. But in a form that leads toward sleep rather than away from it.

**8:00pm — Lights out, sound continues**

Your child lies in the dark, but they're not alone with their thoughts. The sound continues, occupying the part of the brain that would otherwise be racing.

This is the difference between an hour of lying awake and actually falling asleep.

## Why Passive Sound Changes Everything

Let's talk about why this works when other additions to routine don't.

Meditation apps? Most require active engagement — focus on your breathing, follow the instructions, participate. For ADHD children, this adds cognitive demands at exactly the moment they need fewer demands.

Music? It depends. Songs with lyrics engage the language centres of the brain. Familiar music triggers memories and associations. Neither leads toward sleep.

Passive sound is different. Frequencies, soundscapes, ASMR sounds designed for calming — these require nothing from your child. No focus. No participation. No decisions.

They simply give the seeking brain something to settle on.

Research shows children with ADHD respond to their environment differently. The right sensory input helps regulate their arousal levels. The wrong input increases alertness. Passive listening — audio that asks nothing except presence — allows the brain to downregulate naturally.

This is why HushAway® content is designed for passive listening. No tapping required. No choices to make. No interaction needed. Just press play and let the sound do the work.

## The "Just Press Play" Factor

Here's something we understand at HushAway®: you're exhausted too.

By 7pm, you've already survived breakfast negotiations, school run stress, homework resistance, and after-school meltdowns. The last thing you need is a complicated bedtime intervention that requires your active management.

That's why the missing piece works best when it requires nothing from you either.

Press play on a calming soundscape. That's it. You don't need to sit with your child through a guided meditation. You don't need to supervise an app. You don't need to be "doing something" for an hour until they fall asleep.

The sound does the work. Your child's brain has somewhere to settle. Everyone — including you — gets to rest.

## Handling ADHD Bedtime Struggles

Even with a better routine, there will be hard nights. ADHD bedtime struggles don't disappear overnight. But they become manageable.

### "I can't stop thinking"

This is your child telling you their brain needs input, not less input. Respond with: "I know your brain is busy. Here's something for it to listen to while it settles."

Start the calming sounds. Give those thoughts somewhere to go.

### "I'm not tired"

ADHD children often have a delayed circadian rhythm — their melatonin kicks in about 45 minutes later than neurotypical children. They're telling the truth. Their body doesn't feel tired yet.

But here's the key: you can start the settling process before the body feels ready. The calming input helps the brain wind down even when the body hasn't caught up yet.

### "Just one more thing"

The endless requests — water, toilet, questions — are often attempts to manage anxiety or avoid the discomfort of being alone with racing thoughts.

Address the root cause. "I know your brain doesn't want to be alone. Here's something to keep it company."

### Getting up repeatedly

If your child keeps leaving the room, they're likely seeking stimulation their brain is craving. Instead of fighting this battle, provide appropriate stimulation IN the bed — the passive sound that meets their need without requiring them to leave.

## What About Screen Time?

Standard advice says no screens before bed. The blue light argument is real — screens can delay melatonin production.

But here's what the research also shows: for many ADHD children, screens serve a regulatory function. They provide external stimulation that helps the brain focus and calm.

Taking screens away without replacing what they provide leaves the brain hunting for stimulation. It usually finds it in racing thoughts, anxiety, or hyperactive behaviour.

The answer isn't simply "remove screens." It's "replace what screens were providing with something better for sleep."

That replacement is passive sound. It gives the brain the input it's seeking, but in a form designed for settling rather than stimulating.

A practical approach: screens off at the start of the wind-down routine, passive sound starting before lights out. The brain still gets input — just the right kind.

## The Consistency Question

"But we've tried routines before and they don't stick."

The Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust guidance makes an important point: "the ADHD brain takes longer to learn new routines so give it time (months rather than weeks)."

This is hard to hear when you're exhausted. But it's also liberating. You're not failing because the routine isn't working after a week. ADHD brains genuinely need longer to encode new patterns.

The other factor is this: if a routine is missing the key element (passive input for the racing brain), consistency won't help. You'll just be consistently doing something that doesn't work.

Add the missing piece first. Then give it time.

## Calming ADHD Child at Bedtime: Quick Wins

While you're building the longer-term routine, here are immediate things that help:

**Lower your energy first.** Children with ADHD are highly attuned to parental stress. If you're tense and rushed at bedtime, they'll mirror that state. Take a breath before starting the routine. Your calm becomes their calm.

**Reduce decisions.** Every choice requires executive function — something already depleted by end of day. "Do you want the blue or red pyjamas?" becomes a crisis. Just hand them the pyjamas.

**Prepare for transitions.** "In five minutes we're starting the bedtime routine." ADHD brains struggle with sudden changes. Advance warning helps.

**Keep lights dim.** Bright lights signal "daytime" to the brain. Dim the house gradually through the evening.

**Cool the bedroom.** 16-18 degrees Celsius is the recommended range for sleep. Bodies fall asleep more easily when cooling down.

**Start the sound before protests begin.** Don't wait until your child is distressed and resisting. Start the calming sound as part of the routine, before the racing thoughts take over.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Imagine tonight going differently.

Same routine as always — bath, teeth, pyjamas, story. But at 7:45, you press play on a calming soundscape. Your child lies down, and instead of the familiar pattern (lights out, brain racing, calling out, getting up), there's something different.

The sound gives their brain somewhere to settle. Not silence to fight against. Not darkness that amplifies every thought. Just gentle, calming input that meets their brain where it is.

You don't hear them calling out every few minutes. You don't find them standing in the hallway at 9pm. When you check on them at 8:30, they're asleep.

This is what a routine built for ADHD brains can do. Not perfect sleep every night — but manageable nights instead of battles.

## Your Next Step

The Open Sanctuary from HushAway® is a free collection of sounds designed specifically for sensitive and neurodivergent children. You can try it tonight.

Pick something from the night time collection. Add it to your routine after story time. See if it's the missing piece you've been looking for.

## FAQ

### How long should an ADHD bedtime routine take?

Plan for 45-60 minutes from start to lights out. This gives enough time for each transition without rushing. Rushed routines increase anxiety, which makes settling harder. The calming sound portion should continue after lights out — this isn't part of the "active" routine time but extends the settling support.

### What if my child resists every part of the routine?

Resistance often signals overwhelm or too many demands. Simplify the routine to absolute essentials: teeth, toilet, bed, sound. Add other elements back gradually once the basics are established. Also consider timing — starting too early when the body genuinely isn't tired creates unnecessary battles.

### Should the bedtime routine be the same on weekends?

Research shows inconsistent sleep schedules between weekdays and weekends worsen sleep problems for ADHD children. Aim for the same bedtime and routine, with perhaps a 30-minute flexibility on weekends. Major schedule shifts (staying up 2 hours later) take days to recover from.

### My child says the calming sounds are "boring." Should I force them?

"Boring" often means "not stimulating enough to override my racing thoughts." This actually suggests the sounds need to be different, not more engaging. Try different sound types — some children respond better to nature sounds, others to frequencies, others to gentle stories. The goal is something absorbing enough to occupy the brain without requiring active attention.

### How long until an ADHD bedtime routine starts working?

Expect 4-6 weeks before the routine is embedded. You may see improvements in the first week (the passive sound element often shows quick results), but the full routine becoming automatic takes longer. Don't judge the routine's success in week one.

### Does medication affect which bedtime routine works?

Stimulant ADHD medication can extend sleep onset time, meaning your child takes longer to fall asleep even when following a routine. The timing of medication matters — discuss with your prescriber if evening doses seem to affect sleep. The passive sound element becomes even more valuable when medication extends that transition period.
