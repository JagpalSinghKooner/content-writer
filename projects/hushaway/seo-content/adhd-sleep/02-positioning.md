# Positioning: ADHD Sleep

## Market Analysis

**Market sophistication assessment:**
- ADHD sleep content generally: **Stage 3** — crowded with similar behavioural advice, high parent skepticism ("I've tried everything"), mechanism needed to differentiate
- Sound-based ADHD sleep solutions: **Stage 1-2** — novel angle, no UK competitor owns this space

**Strategic move:** Introduce a new mechanism (passive listening) to a Stage 3 market. The first to explain WHY sound works for ADHD brains will own this angle.

**The transformation:**
- **From:** Exhausted parent. Child who won't sleep. Racing ADHD brain that won't switch off. Bedtime battles lasting hours. Failed routines. Failed apps. Failed everything.
- **To:** Calm bedtimes. Child who falls asleep. No complex interventions. No parental effort required. Just press play.

**The unique mechanism:**
- "Passive listening" — no interaction required, no tapping, no choices, just press play
- Frequency-based sounds and ASMR designed specifically for neurodivergent brains (not adapted from neurotypical content)
- Works WITH the racing brain (gives it something calming to focus on) instead of fighting against it (trying to force it quiet)

## Primary Angle (Pillar Guide)

**Article:** The Complete Guide to ADHD Sleep Problems in Children
**Target keyword:** adhd sleep problems

**The angle:** Every piece of ADHD sleep advice focuses on behaviour and environment — but none of it addresses what's actually keeping your child awake: a brain that won't switch off. Sound is the missing piece that gives the racing ADHD brain something calming to focus on.

**Why it works:**
- Validates that parents have tried everything (behavioural, environmental, routine)
- Explains WHY those approaches don't fully work (they don't address the racing brain)
- Introduces mechanism (passive sound) that's new to this market
- Zero-effort positioning appeals to exhausted parents
- Differentiates from NHS clinical advice and competitor behavioural interventions

**Headline direction:** "ADHD Sleep Problems: The Missing Piece Nobody Talks About"

**This angle claims:** Sound-based passive listening is what's missing from current ADHD sleep guidance. The racing brain needs INPUT (calming sound), not just OUTPUT reduction (behavioural rules).

**This angle rejects:** The idea that more routine, stricter rules, or better "sleep hygiene" alone will solve ADHD sleep problems. Those approaches fight the brain instead of working with it.

## Secondary Angles

### Article 1: Why Your ADHD Child Won't Sleep (And What Actually Helps)
**Target keyword:** adhd child won't sleep

**The angle:** Generic sleep advice fails ADHD kids because their brains are wired differently. The "rules" neurotypical kids follow don't apply — and that's not a parenting failure, it's neurobiology.

**Why it works:**
- Validates exhausted parents who've "tried everything"
- Removes parental guilt ("it's not that you're doing it wrong")
- Explains the WHY behind ADHD sleep problems
- Creates opening for ADHD-specific solutions (sound)

**Headline direction:** "Why Your ADHD Child Won't Sleep (It's Not What You Think)"

**Reinforces primary via:** Sets up that current advice is incomplete — something fundamental is missing. Prepares the reader to accept sound as the missing piece when introduced.

---

### Article 2: ADHD Bedtime Routine That Actually Works
**Target keyword:** adhd bedtime routine

**The angle:** ADHD kids don't resist routine — they resist routines designed for neurotypical brains. A routine that works WITH the ADHD brain includes what most routines leave out: something to give the racing thoughts somewhere to go.

**Why it works:**
- Contrarian to standard advice ("establish a routine" — parents have heard this)
- Explains why typical routines fail for ADHD
- Positions routine as necessary but insufficient
- Opens door to add passive listening as the missing element

**Headline direction:** "ADHD Bedtime Routine: Why Yours Isn't Working (And How to Fix It)"

**Reinforces primary via:** Routine alone isn't the answer — the routine needs to include the missing piece. Positions sound as what makes a routine ADHD-friendly rather than generic.

---

### Article 3: Best Calming Sounds for ADHD Children (Backed by Research)
**Target keyword:** calming sounds for adhd child

**The angle:** Not all sounds calm ADHD brains — some make things worse. The sounds that work share specific properties (frequencies, patterns, passive engagement) that align with how the ADHD brain processes stimulation.

**Why it works:**
- High commercial intent keyword — reader is actively looking for sound solutions
- Positions HushAway® as the expert on WHICH sounds work and WHY
- Research-backed credibility builds trust
- Directly relevant to The Open Sanctuary (product demonstration)

**Headline direction:** "Calming Sounds for ADHD Children: Which Actually Work (And Why)"

**Reinforces primary via:** This IS the missing piece, explained in detail. Connects the mechanism (sound) to specific properties that make it work for ADHD brains specifically.

---

### Article 4: Racing Thoughts at Bedtime: Quieting the ADHD Brain
**Target keyword:** adhd racing thoughts child

**The angle:** You can't force an ADHD brain to stop thinking — that's like telling someone not to think of a pink elephant. Instead, you redirect it. Give it something calming to think about, and the racing thoughts have somewhere to go.

**Why it works:**
- Directly addresses the core problem HushAway® solves
- Explains the mechanism in parent-friendly terms
- Reframes from "stop thinking" (impossible) to "redirect" (achievable)
- Clear path to sound as the redirection tool

**Headline direction:** "Racing Thoughts at Bedtime: How to Quiet an ADHD Brain That Won't Switch Off"

**Reinforces primary via:** This article explains the MECHANISM behind why sound works — passive listening gives racing thoughts somewhere calm to land. The racing brain isn't defective; it just needs the right input.

---

### Article 5: Beyond Melatonin: Non-Medication Sleep Help for ADHD Children
**Target keyword:** non-medication adhd sleep help

**The angle:** Melatonin isn't the only option — and for many ADHD kids, it's not enough on its own. There are zero-effort alternatives that work alongside (or instead of) medication, but most parents don't know about them.

**Why it works:**
- UK-specific value (melatonin requires prescription, different context than US)
- Parents searching this are looking for alternatives — high intent
- Positions sound as complement or alternative to medication
- Zero-effort appeal for parents avoiding complex interventions

**Headline direction:** "Non-Medication ADHD Sleep Help: What UK Parents Need to Know"

**Reinforces primary via:** Expands the "missing piece" beyond behaviour to include what's missing from the medication conversation. Sound isn't replacing medication — it's addressing what medication doesn't (the racing brain needs input).

---

### Article 6: ADHD Sleep vs Autism Sleep: Understanding the Differences
**Target keyword:** adhd sleep vs autism sleep

**The angle:** ADHD and autism cause different sleep problems — but they're often lumped together as "neurodivergent sleep issues." Understanding which challenges your child faces (especially with comorbidity) helps you find solutions that actually fit.

**Why it works:**
- Addresses large comorbid audience (common in HushAway® target market)
- Positions as understanding resource for complex situations
- Creates bridge to Autistic Meltdowns pillar (when created)
- Builds authority on neurodivergent expertise broadly

**Headline direction:** "ADHD Sleep vs Autism Sleep: A Parent's Guide to the Differences"

**Reinforces primary via:** Tailored solutions matter — generic "neurodivergent" advice misses the specifics. Sound-based solutions can work for both, but understanding the difference helps parents choose the right sounds for their child's specific needs.

## Consistency Check

**All angles share:**
- Current advice is incomplete — something is missing
- ADHD brains work differently, so solutions need to be ADHD-specific
- "Just try harder" / "be more consistent" isn't the answer
- Zero-effort solutions exist for exhausted parents
- Passive listening (sound) addresses what behaviour-only approaches can't

**Primary angle establishes:** Sound is the missing piece — the passive solution that works WITH the racing brain rather than trying to force it quiet.

**Supporting angles extend via:**
- **Article 1 (Won't Sleep):** Explains WHY current advice fails → creates the "something is missing" realisation
- **Article 2 (Routine):** Routine is necessary but insufficient → the missing piece is what goes INTO the routine
- **Article 3 (Calming Sounds):** This IS the missing piece → explains which sounds and why they work
- **Article 4 (Racing Thoughts):** The mechanism → sound gives racing thoughts somewhere calm to land
- **Article 5 (Beyond Melatonin):** Missing from the medication conversation too → sound as complement/alternative
- **Article 6 (ADHD vs Autism):** Tailored solutions matter → understanding differences helps choose the right sounds

**Potential conflicts:**
- Article 2 (Routine) could be read as "routine doesn't matter" — but the angle is that routine IS important, it just needs the missing element. Resolution: Emphasise "routine + the missing piece" not "routine doesn't work."
- Article 5 (Beyond Melatonin) could seem anti-medication — but the angle is "in addition to" or "instead of for those who prefer." Resolution: Position as options, not judgments. Some kids need medication AND sound.

**Reader journey:**
Someone discovering HushAway® through any article encounters the same core truth: ADHD sleep problems persist because current advice is incomplete. Whether they enter through "my child won't sleep" (Article 1), "racing thoughts" (Article 4), or "non-medication options" (Article 5), they find the same answer — sound-based passive listening is what's been missing.

The journey builds:
1. **Realisation:** Generic advice doesn't work for ADHD brains (Articles 1, 2)
2. **Understanding:** The racing brain needs INPUT, not just rules (Article 4)
3. **Solution:** Sound is the missing piece (Articles 3, 5)
4. **Comprehensive:** The full picture, with all pieces together (Pillar Guide)

A reader who consumes multiple articles reinforces the positioning each time — never encountering contradictions, always building toward the same conclusion.
