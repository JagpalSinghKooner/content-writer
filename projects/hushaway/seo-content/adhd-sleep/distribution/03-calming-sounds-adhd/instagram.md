# Instagram Content: Calming Sounds for ADHD

---

## Carousel

### Slide 1 (Hook)
**"Not all calming sounds calm ADHD brains."**

Most generic sleep sounds don't work for your child.

Here's what actually does (backed by research)

→

### Slide 2 (The Problem)
**Why sound works differently for ADHD**

An ADHD brain in a silent room is like a hungry person in an empty kitchen.

It opens every cupboard.
Checks the fridge.
Opens the cupboards again.

Hunting. Restless.

→

### Slide 3 (The Science)
**What 2024 research found:**

White and pink noise improved focus in children with ADHD.

BUT the same sounds made neurotypical children perform worse.

ADHD brains genuinely respond differently to sound.

→

### Slide 4 (White Noise)
**White noise**

Contains all frequencies at equal intensity.
Sounds like static or a fan.

Best for: Children whose main struggle is attention (not hyperactivity)

Research shows it helps with focus, attention, and settling.

→

### Slide 5 (Pink Noise)
**Pink noise**

Deeper than white noise.
Softer. More like steady rainfall.

Best for: Children who find white noise too harsh or "scratchy"

Same research backing as white noise — gentler on the ears.

→

### Slide 6 (Brown Noise)
**Brown noise**

Even deeper. Like rumbling thunder or distant ocean.

Honest truth: No published studies yet (despite TikTok claims).

Worth trying if white/pink feel too bright.

→

### Slide 7 (What Works)
**What makes sound calming for ADHD:**

Passive — no interaction needed
Consistent — no sudden changes
Just right — interesting enough to occupy, not so interesting it captures full attention
No demands — no instructions to follow

→

### Slide 8 (Warning Signs)
**Signs to watch for:**

Good: Body relaxes. Breathing slows. They say it's "boring" (perfect!)

Not right: Covering ears. Restlessness. Complaining it's annoying.

Different sounds work for different children.

→

### Slide 9 (How to Start)
**Start tonight:**

1. Pick white or pink noise (strongest research)
2. Play 15-20 mins before bed
3. Keep volume moderate — you can talk over it
4. Watch your child's response

Their reaction tells you more than any study.

→

### Slide 10 (CTA)
**The Open Sanctuary from HushAway®**

Free sounds built for sensitive and neurodivergent children.

Frequencies. Soundscapes. ASMR.
All passive listening — just press play.

## Caption

Not all calming sounds calm ADHD brains.

Some sounds that work brilliantly for neurotypical children can actually increase alertness in ADHD kids. Others cause irritation.

A 2024 meta-analysis found white and pink noise helped children with ADHD focus better — but the same sounds made neurotypical children perform worse.

This tells us something important: ADHD brains genuinely respond differently to sound.

The sounds that work share specific properties:
- Passive (no interaction required)
- Consistent (no jarring changes)
- No demands or instructions

Swipe through to see which sounds are backed by research and which are just TikTok hype.

Then tonight — pick one. Press play. Watch how your child responds.

Their reaction will tell you everything.

Save this for bedtime tonight.
Share with a parent who needs this.

## Reel Notes

- **Audio:** Use a calming trending sound at low volume, or original voiceover
- **Visuals:** Soft, muted colours. Child settling. Parent exhaling with relief. No overstimulating transitions.
- **Text overlays:** Keep large, readable. Key phrases only.
- **Pace:** Slower than typical Reels. Matches the calming brand.
