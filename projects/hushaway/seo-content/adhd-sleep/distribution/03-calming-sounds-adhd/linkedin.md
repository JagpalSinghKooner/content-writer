# LinkedIn Distribution: Calming Sounds for ADHD

## Carousel: Which Sounds Actually Help ADHD Brains Settle

**Design notes:** 1080x1350px (4:5 ratio), consistent brand colours, minimal design, readable at small size. Font size minimum 24pt body, 40pt+ headlines.

---

### Slide 1: Hook

**Headline:**
The sounds that calm ADHD brains are different.

**Subtext:**
Here's what the research actually shows.

---

### Slide 2: The Problem

**Headline:**
Not all calming sounds calm ADHD brains.

**Body:**
That white noise machine that helps your neurotypical niece sleep?

It might leave your ADHD child wide awake.

Some sounds that work brilliantly for other children can actually increase alertness in ADHD kids.

---

### Slide 3: Why It Happens

**Headline:**
ADHD brains need input to settle.

**Body:**
A quiet room is the problem.

When external stimulation drops, the ADHD brain hunts for something to focus on.

Usually it finds racing thoughts.

The right sound gives the brain what it's seeking — so it stops seeking.

---

### Slide 4: The Research

**Headline:**
2024 meta-analysis: 13 studies, 335 children

**Body:**
White and pink noise produced significant improvements in focus for ADHD children.

The same sounds had the opposite effect on neurotypical children.

This isn't about preferences. It's neurobiology.

---

### Slide 5: What Works — White Noise

**Headline:**
White noise: Most studied

**Body:**
Contains all frequencies at equal intensity.

Sounds like static or a fan.

Works best for children whose main struggle is attention, not hyperactivity.

---

### Slide 6: What Works — Pink Noise

**Headline:**
Pink noise: Softer option

**Body:**
Like white noise but with reduced high frequencies.

Sounds like steady rainfall.

Some parents find it less harsh for bedtime.

---

### Slide 7: What About Brown Noise?

**Headline:**
Brown noise: Popular but unproven

**Body:**
Despite millions of claims on social media, there are currently no published studies on brown noise and ADHD.

The 2024 meta-analysis noted: "No studies of brown noise were identified."

Worth trying, but don't expect guarantees.

---

### Slide 8: What Makes Sound Work

**Headline:**
4 things that make sound calming for ADHD:

**Body:**
1. Passive engagement — requires nothing from your child
2. Consistent — no jarring variations or sudden silence
3. Right level of stimulation — interesting enough to settle the brain, not capture it
4. No instructions — just sound, not guided meditations

---

### Slide 9: How to Find What Works

**Headline:**
Watch for these signs:

**Body:**
Good signs:
- Body relaxes
- Breathing slows
- Says it's "boring" (perfect!)

Warning signs:
- Increased restlessness
- Covering ears
- Complaining it's annoying

Different sounds work for different children.

---

### Slide 10: CTA

**Headline:**
The missing piece might be the right sound.

**Body:**
The Open Sanctuary from HushAway® is our free sound collection built for neurodivergent children.

Frequencies. Soundscapes. ASMR.

All passive — no interaction required.

We built it because we needed it too.

**CTA:**
Save this for later. Share with someone who needs it.

## Text Post 1: The Research Angle

The same white noise that helps ADHD children focus can actually reduce performance in neurotypical children.

This isn't opinion. It's from a 2024 meta-analysis of 13 studies.

The explanation? ADHD brains are typically under-aroused and constantly seeking stimulation.

Adding the right amount of external sound brings arousal to the right level.

Neurotypical brains are already at that level. Extra noise pushes them beyond it.

This is why generic "sleep sounds" often don't work for our kids.

Their brains have different needs.

What sounds have you tried for your child?

---

## Text Post 2: The Parent Experience

You've tried the sounds.

White noise machines. Rain recordings. Those brown noise videos that social media promised would fix everything.

Maybe they helped a bit. Or maybe — and this is the frustrating part — they made things worse.

Here's what nobody told me:

Not all calming sounds calm ADHD brains.

Some sounds that work for neurotypical children actually increase alertness in ADHD kids. Others cause irritation.

The sounds that work share specific properties:
- They ask nothing from your child (passive listening)
- They're consistent without jarring changes
- They give the brain just enough input to stop hunting for stimulation

My child's response taught me more than any research study.

White noise? Made her more alert.
Pink noise with rain underneath? She was asleep in 20 minutes.

Every ADHD brain is different. The trick is finding what yours needs.

What's worked for your family?

## Text Post 3: The Product Bridge

When nothing was working at bedtime, I started researching sound and ADHD.

What I found surprised me:

There's actual research showing white and pink noise help ADHD children focus and settle. A 2024 meta-analysis confirmed it across 13 studies.

But here's what made the difference for us:

The sound had to be passive. No instructions. No engagement required. Just... there.

Most apps ask too much. Follow the breathing. Make choices. Tap things.

An ADHD brain at bedtime doesn't need more demands. It needs permission to stop.

That's why we built HushAway®. Frequencies, soundscapes, and ASMR designed for neurodivergent children.

Press play. That's it. Nothing else required.

The Open Sanctuary is free. Always will be.

Because the missing piece shouldn't cost you anything to find.
