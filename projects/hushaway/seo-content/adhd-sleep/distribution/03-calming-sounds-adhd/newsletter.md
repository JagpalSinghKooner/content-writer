# Newsletter: Calming Sounds for ADHD

---

## Hook

Here's what nobody told you about those brown noise videos on social media: there's actually zero peer-reviewed research behind them.

## Body

I know. I was surprised too.

When we started looking into which sounds actually help ADHD children settle at night, we expected the research to back up what everyone's been sharing online. Instead, we found something more interesting — and more useful.

A 2024 meta-analysis looked at 13 studies involving 335 children with ADHD. The findings were clear: **white and pink noise genuinely help ADHD brains settle**. But here's the bit that matters for your household — the same sounds had the *opposite* effect on neurotypical children.

This isn't about preferences. It's about how ADHD brains process stimulation.

Think of it this way: an ADHD brain in a quiet room is like a hungry person in an empty kitchen. It opens every cupboard, checks the fridge, opens the cupboards again. Hunting. Restless. But give that brain steady, undemanding input — the right sound — and the searching stops. It has what it needs.

The article breaks down exactly which sounds work (white, pink, brown, ASMR, frequencies) and which children they work best for. Because an inattentive child responds differently than a hyperactive one. That distinction alone might save you months of trial and error.
