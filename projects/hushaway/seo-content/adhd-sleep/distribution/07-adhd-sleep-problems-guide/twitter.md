# Twitter/X Distribution: ADHD Sleep Problems Guide

## Thread: The Missing Piece Framework

### 1/

75% of ADHD children have sleep problems.

You've tried everything: consistent routines, screen limits, maybe even melatonin.

Nothing really solves it.

Here's the missing piece nobody talks about:

🧵

### 2/

Standard sleep advice says:

- Remove screens
- Create darkness
- Make it quiet

This works for neurotypical brains.

For ADHD brains? You've just removed every external focus.

Now their brain fills the vacuum with racing thoughts.

### 3/

ADHD brains don't have an automatic "off switch" for thoughts.

When external stimulation stops, internal stimulation ramps up.

The quieter the room, the louder the brain becomes.

### 4/

Melatonin helps your child feel sleepy.

But it doesn't quiet the racing brain.

Result: A child who is physically tired, mentally wired, and frustrated by the mismatch.

Melatonin addresses half the problem.

### 5/

The missing piece:

ADHD brains need INPUT to calm down, not just removal of input.

Read that again.

It's the opposite of what most sleep advice tells you.

### 6/

Research backs this up.

A 2024 meta-analysis found white and pink noise improved cognitive function in ADHD children.

The same sounds had the OPPOSITE effect on neurotypical children.

ADHD brains are genuinely wired differently.

### 7/

The leading theory: ADHD brains are under-aroused.

They're constantly seeking stimulation.

At bedtime, when external stimulation drops, the brain creates its own: racing thoughts, physical restlessness.

### 8/

Passive sound provides just enough external input to satisfy that need.

The brain stops generating its own stimulation.

Racing thoughts quiet naturally — not because they're forced to stop, but because they're no longer needed.

### 9/

Key word: "passive."

Active engagement (games, apps with choices) increases alertness.

Passive listening — audio requiring nothing except presence — lets the brain downregulate naturally.

### 10/

What this looks like in practice:

Sound starts as part of the bedtime routine.

Your child lies in the dark, but they're not alone with their thoughts.

The sound catches racing thoughts before they spiral.

### 11/

You've been following the right advice.

It was just advice designed for different brains.

You haven't failed. You've been solving the wrong problem.

### 12/

One change tonight:

Add calming passive sound as your child settles.

Before the racing thoughts take over.

Give their brain somewhere to rest.

RT the first tweet if you've been fighting this battle.

## Singles

### Single 1

"Telling an ADHD child to 'just relax' asks them to do something neurologically difficult for their brain."

What looks like not trying is often a child who has tried everything they know and failed.

The answer isn't more effort — it's different strategies.

### Single 2

Your ADHD child isn't choosing to lie awake.

They can't decide to stop their brain racing any more than they can decide to stop being hungry.

Brain wiring, not willpower.

### Single 3

The ADHD sleep vicious cycle:

Poor sleep → worse ADHD symptoms → more stressful day → harder night → poor sleep

Breaking the cycle at night can change everything about the day.

### Single 4

Parents of ADHD kids by 8pm:

Already survived breakfast battles, school run, homework struggles, after-school meltdowns, dinner negotiations.

The last thing you need is another technique to implement.

Press play. That's it. That's the solution.

### Single 5

Research shows ADHD children have melatonin onset about 45 minutes later than neurotypical children.

When you put them to bed at 8pm because that's when children "should" sleep, their brain isn't ready.

They're not defiant. Their body clock runs differently.
