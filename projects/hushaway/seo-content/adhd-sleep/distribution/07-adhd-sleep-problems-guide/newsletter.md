# Newsletter: ADHD Sleep Problems Guide

## Hook

Three in four ADHD children struggle to sleep — and most of the advice out there wasn't designed for how their brains actually work.

## Body

I've lost count of how many parents tell me the same thing: "We've done everything right. Consistent routine. No screens. Cool, dark room. And still, bedtime feels like walking into a battle we've already lost."

Here's what I wish more people talked about. The standard sleep advice — the stuff that works brilliantly for neurotypical children — misses something fundamental about ADHD brains. When we remove distractions and make the room quiet, we're trying to create calm by taking things away. But ADHD brains don't work like that. They fill the silence with racing thoughts, worries, questions about dinosaurs, replays of conversations from three weeks ago.

The racing brain isn't a choice. It's neurobiology. Research from the University of Nottingham found that children with ADHD struggle to switch off the part of their brain responsible for spontaneous thoughts. At bedtime, with nothing interesting to focus on, that internal world takes over.

So what actually helps? Giving the brain something calming TO focus on, instead of fighting to focus on nothing. That's why we built HushAway® around passive listening — sounds that require zero effort from exhausted parents and nothing from your child except being present.
