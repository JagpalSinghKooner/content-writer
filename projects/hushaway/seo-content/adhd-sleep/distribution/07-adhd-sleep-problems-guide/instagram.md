# Instagram Distribution: ADHD Sleep Problems Guide

## Carousel (10 Slides)

### Slide 1 — HOOK

**Text:**
Your ADHD child's brain can't just "switch off" at bedtime.

**Design:** Bold white text on deep blue/purple gradient. No other elements.

---

### Slide 2 — THE PROBLEM

**Text:**
75% of ADHD children have sleep problems.

Standard advice? It wasn't made for their brains.

**Design:** Statistic in large bold text. Smaller text below.

---

### Slide 3 — WHY IT'S DIFFERENT

**Text:**
Neurotypical brains slow down when it's quiet.

ADHD brains? They ramp UP.

The quieter the room, the louder the thoughts.

**Design:** Simple contrast visual — calm brain vs active brain icons.

---

### Slide 4 — THE SCIENCE

**Text:**
Research shows ADHD children have a delayed internal clock — their melatonin kicks in 45 minutes later than other children.

They're not being difficult. Their body genuinely isn't ready.

**Design:** Clock icon with time shift visual.

---

### Slide 5 — WHY STANDARD ADVICE FAILS

**Text:**
"Just be consistent"
"Remove screens"
"Make them tired"

You've done all of this. It didn't work because it was designed for different brains.

**Design:** Strikethrough text effect on the quoted advice.

---

### Slide 6 — THE MISSING PIECE

**Text:**
ADHD brains need INPUT to calm down.

Not less stimulation. The RIGHT kind.

**Design:** Bold headline. Arrow pointing to next slide.

---

### Slide 7 — WHY SOUND WORKS

**Text:**
White and pink noise improve focus for ADHD children.

(The same sounds reduce focus in neurotypical children.)

Different brains. Different needs.

**Design:** Sound wave visual. Citation note at bottom.

---

### Slide 8 — HOW IT HELPS

**Text:**
Passive sound gives racing thoughts somewhere to rest.

No choices. No effort. Just press play.

**Design:** Play button icon. Simple, calming aesthetic.

---

### Slide 9 — WHAT TO TRY TONIGHT

**Text:**
Start calming sounds BEFORE bedtime struggles begin.

Give it a week. ADHD brains need time to learn new patterns.

**Design:** Numbered list format.

---

### Slide 10 — CTA

**Text:**
Save this for those 10pm "why won't they sleep" moments.

The Open Sanctuary from HushAway has free sounds made for neurodivergent children.

Link in bio.

**Design:** Save icon. HushAway branding.

---

## Caption

Your ADHD child isn't choosing to stay awake.

They can't just "switch off" their racing brain any more than they can decide to stop being hungry. And you're not failing them — you've probably tried harder than most parents ever have to.

Here's what nobody tells you: standard sleep advice was designed for neurotypical brains. The quiet, dark room that signals "time to sleep" for most children? For an ADHD brain, it's a vacuum. And brains fill vacuums — with thoughts, worries, questions, ideas. All at once.

The missing piece isn't trying harder. It's giving their brain something calming to focus on.

Research shows passive sound actually helps ADHD children — white noise, pink noise, gentle audio that requires nothing from them. Just press play.

Save this for the hard nights.

## Reel Script (25 seconds)

**Hook (0-3 seconds):**
[Parent looking exhausted, text overlay: "POV: It's 10pm and your ADHD child is still awake"]

**Body (3-20 seconds):**
[Speaking to camera, calm but relatable tone]

"Here's what I wish someone had told me earlier.

ADHD brains don't have an automatic off switch for thoughts. When you make the room quiet, their brain gets LOUDER.

The answer isn't fighting to focus on nothing. It's giving their brain something calming TO focus on.

Passive sound — no choices, no effort — gives racing thoughts somewhere to rest."

**CTA (20-25 seconds):**
[Text overlay with call to action]

"The Open Sanctuary has free sounds for neurodivergent children. Link in bio."

**Audio suggestion:** Trending calm/ambient sound or original audio
