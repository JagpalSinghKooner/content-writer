# LinkedIn Content: ADHD Sleep Problems Guide

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook

**75% of ADHD children have sleep problems**

Yet most advice is designed for neurotypical brains.

Swipe to see what actually works →

### Slide 2: The Problem

**Generic sleep advice fails ADHD children**

"Consistent routine"
"Remove screens"
"Make it quiet"

You've tried all of this.

It doesn't work because it was built for different brains.

### Slide 3: The Real Issue

**The ADHD brain doesn't have an "off switch" for thoughts**

When external stimulation stops...
Internal stimulation ramps up.

Quieter room = louder brain.

### Slide 4: The Circadian Difference

**ADHD children run on a delayed body clock**

Research shows their melatonin kicks in 45 minutes later than neurotypical children.

8pm bedtime? Their brain isn't ready yet.

They're not being defiant. They're wired differently.

### Slide 5: What Doesn't Work

**Melatonin alone misses half the problem**

Melatonin helps children feel sleepy.

It doesn't quiet the racing brain.

Result: Physically tired. Mentally wired. Frustrated.

### Slide 6: The Missing Piece

**ADHD brains need INPUT to calm down**

Not the removal of input.

Taking things away leaves their brain in a vacuum.

Brains fill vacuums with racing thoughts, anxiety, restless energy.

### Slide 7: What Actually Works

**Passive sound gives the brain somewhere to rest**

Research shows white/pink noise helps ADHD children but slightly hinders neurotypical children.

Their brains are wired to need input.

Give them the right kind — calm, consistent, requiring nothing.

### Slide 8: The Practical Approach

**Build sound into the routine:**

1. Wind-down begins 45-60 mins before bed
2. Passive sound starts during settling
3. Lights out, sound continues
4. Racing thoughts have somewhere to land

### Slide 9: What to Expect

**Timeline for change:**

Week 1: Some improvement in settling time
Weeks 2-4: Sound becomes normal, routine embeds
Months 1-3: ADHD brains learn new patterns

Don't judge after three nights. Give it time.

### Slide 10: CTA

**You're not failing. You're working with the wrong advice.**

Your child isn't choosing to stay awake.
Their brain works differently.

## Text Post 1: The Core Insight

75% of ADHD children have sleep problems.

Three in four. Yet most sleep advice was designed for neurotypical brains.

"Make the room quiet."
"Establish a consistent routine."
"Remove screens before bed."

You've done all of this. For months. Maybe years.

Here's what nobody tells you:

ADHD brains don't have an automatic "off switch" for thoughts.

When the room goes quiet, the brain gets louder. Racing thoughts. Random questions. Replaying the day. Planning tomorrow.

The solution isn't fighting to focus on nothing.

It's giving the brain something calming TO focus on.

Research shows white and pink noise actually help ADHD children — but slightly hinder neurotypical children. Their brains genuinely respond differently.

What looks like defiance is usually a brain that can't switch off because it wasn't given what it needs to settle.

You haven't failed. You've been following advice designed for different brains.

What's helped your ADHD child sleep? Genuinely curious what's worked for other families.

## Text Post 2: The Melatonin Truth

"Have you tried melatonin?"

If you have an ADHD child who won't sleep, you've heard this a hundred times.

Here's what they don't tell you:

Melatonin helps children feel sleepy.
It doesn't quiet the racing brain.

Your child takes it. Thirty minutes later, eyes get heavy. Body relaxes.

But the brain? Still racing. Still generating thoughts. Still unable to settle.

Result: A child who is physically tired, mentally wired, and frustrated by the mismatch.

This is why some parents say melatonin "worked at first" then stopped. Tolerance didn't develop — melatonin was only ever addressing half the problem.

The other half? The brain that needs INPUT to calm down.

Most advice tells you to remove stimulation. But ADHD brains fill that vacuum with their own content: racing thoughts, anxiety, restless energy.

Passive sound — calm audio that requires nothing from your child — gives the brain somewhere to rest.

Research backs this. White and pink noise actually help ADHD children while having the opposite effect on neurotypical children.

Different brains need different solutions.

Anyone else found melatonin wasn't enough on its own? What did you add that helped?

## Text Post 3: The Body Clock Truth

Your ADHD child isn't being defiant at bedtime.

Their body clock literally runs on a different schedule.

Research from 2025 found that 73-78% of children with ADHD have a delayed sleep/wake cycle. Their melatonin kicks in about 45 minutes later than neurotypical children.

When you put them to bed at 8pm because that's when children "should" sleep — their brain genuinely isn't ready yet.

This explains something many parents notice:

Their ADHD child comes alive in the evening.

While siblings wind down, the ADHD child has a second wind. While other kids get drowsy, yours is alert and active.

They're not trying to cause problems. Their body is genuinely awake when others are ready for sleep.

It also explains the morning battle. If their body clock runs late, getting up for school feels like the middle of the night to their system.

Working WITH this rhythm (rather than against it) changes everything.

Does your child seem to wake up at night? That delayed clock is real.
