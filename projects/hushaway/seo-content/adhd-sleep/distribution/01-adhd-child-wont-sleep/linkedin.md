# LinkedIn Distribution: ADHD Child Won't Sleep

## Carousel (10 Slides)

### Slide 1 (Hook)
**You've done everything right.**

Bath. Story. Same time every night.

Your ADHD child still won't sleep.

Here's why — and what actually works.

---

### Slide 2 (The Problem)
**75% of ADHD children have sleep problems.**

That's not a parenting failure.

That's neurobiology.

(University Hospital Southampton, 2022)

---

### Slide 3 (Why Generic Advice Fails)
**Standard sleep advice was written for a different kind of brain.**

Cool room. No screens. Calming routine.

This works for neurotypical children.

ADHD brains don't respond the same way.

---

### Slide 4 (The Racing Brain)
**When the room goes quiet, the ADHD brain gets LOUDER.**

No "off switch" for thoughts.

Ideas. Worries. Random questions.

The quieter the room, the noisier the brain.

---

### Slide 5 (The Clock Problem)
**ADHD brains run on a different internal clock.**

Melatonin kicks in 45 minutes later than neurotypical children.

8pm bedtime? Their brain isn't ready yet.

They're not being defiant. Their body clock is simply different.

---

### Slide 6 (What Doesn't Work)
**What doesn't work:**

- Removing all stimulation
- Telling them to "just relax"
- Trying harder at routines
- Exercise alone

The ADHD brain needs INPUT to calm down.

Not just the removal of input.

---

### Slide 7 (What Actually Works)
**The missing piece:**

Give the brain something calming TO focus on.

Rather than fighting to focus on nothing.

Passive sound. Frequencies. Gentle audio.

Something that occupies the racing mind — without requiring effort.

---

### Slide 8 (Why Passive Matters)
**By 8pm, you've got nothing left.**

The last thing you need is another strategy requiring your energy.

That's why passive works.

Press play. Walk away.

Your child doesn't need to try. You don't need to supervise.

---

### Slide 9 (The Shift)
**The racing thoughts slow.**

The resistance reduces.

Not perfect sleep overnight — but manageable.

Sound gives thoughts somewhere to land.

---

### Slide 10 (CTA)
**You've already tried harder than most people will ever understand.**

Your child's brain just needs something calm to land on.

### Post 1: The Guilt Post

10pm. Then 11pm. Then midnight.

Your ADHD child is still awake.

You've done the bath. The story. The blackout blinds. The no-screens rule. The whole routine.

And it still doesn't work.

So you blame yourself. Because every sleep book tells you it's about consistency. About trying harder.

Here's what the research actually says:

75% of ADHD children have sleep problems.

Their melatonin kicks in 45 minutes later than neurotypical children.

Their brains don't have an "off switch" for racing thoughts.

When the room goes quiet, their brain gets louder.

This isn't a parenting failure. It's neurobiology.

The standard sleep advice? It was written for a different kind of brain.

You're not doing anything wrong.

Your child's brain just works differently.

And once you understand that, you can stop trying harder at things that were never going to work — and start finding what actually helps.

What's your experience with ADHD and sleep? I'd love to hear from other parents.

### Post 2: The Missing Piece Post

Every ADHD sleep guide says the same thing:

Remove screens. Dark room. Calm routine.

Here's what they miss:

ADHD brains need INPUT to calm down. Not just the removal of input.

When you take everything away — screens, activity, stimulation — you leave the ADHD brain in a vacuum.

And brains don't like vacuums. They fill them.

Usually with racing thoughts. Anxiety. Restless energy.

The solution isn't taking more away.

It's giving the brain something calming TO focus on.

Passive sound. Frequencies. Gentle audio that requires nothing except presence.

Something that occupies the racing mind — in a way that leads toward sleep rather than away from it.

The difference? Parents notice it within days.

Not perfect sleep overnight.

But the hours-long battles become manageable.

The racing thoughts slow.

The resistance reduces.

What helps your ADHD child settle at night?

### Post 3: The Different Clock Post

Your ADHD child isn't being defiant at bedtime.

Their body clock is literally running on a different schedule.

Research shows 73-78% of people with ADHD have a delayed sleep/wake cycle.

Their melatonin — the sleep hormone — kicks in about 45 minutes later than neurotypical children.

So when you put your child to bed at 8pm because that's when children "should" go to bed...

Their brain genuinely isn't ready for sleep yet.

They're not fighting you on purpose. They're not "just being difficult."

Their internal clock is simply different.

This changes everything about how we approach ADHD sleep.

Fighting their biology doesn't work.

Working WITH it does.

Have you noticed this pattern with your child?
