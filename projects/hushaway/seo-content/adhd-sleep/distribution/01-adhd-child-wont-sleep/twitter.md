# Twitter/X Content: Why Your ADHD Child Won't Sleep

---

## Thread

1/ You've done everything "right."

Bath. Story. Same time every night. Blackout blinds. No screens.

And your ADHD child STILL won't sleep.

Here's why — and what actually works:

2/ By midnight, you're in tears on the sofa.

They're wide awake.

You've tried harder than most parents ever have to try.

The problem isn't you. The problem is every sleep guide was written for a different kind of brain.

3/ Here's the truth:

Almost 75% of children with ADHD have sleep problems.

That's not coincidence. That's neurobiology.

(Source: University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, 2022)

4/ The core issue: ADHD brains don't have an "off switch" for thoughts.

When neurotypical kids lie down, their brains naturally slow.

ADHD brains? The quieter the room, the LOUDER the brain becomes.

5/ It gets more interesting.

73-78% of children with ADHD have a delayed sleep/wake cycle.

Their melatonin kicks in about 45 minutes LATER than neurotypical children.

When you put them to bed at 8pm, their brain genuinely isn't ready yet.

6/ This explains so much.

They're not being defiant.
They're not "just being difficult."
They're not testing boundaries.

Their body clock runs on a different schedule.

7/ What most advice misses:

ADHD brains need INPUT to calm down, not just removal of input.

When we take things away (screens, activity, stimulation), we leave the brain in a vacuum.

And brains fill vacuums — usually with racing thoughts or anxiety.

8/ The solution isn't fighting to focus on nothing.

It's giving the brain something calming TO focus on.

Passive sound works because it gives racing thoughts somewhere to land.

9/ Research shows ADHD children respond remarkably well to passive auditory input.

Not meditation they need to concentrate on.
Not apps that require choices.

Just steady, calming sound that requires nothing except presence.

10/ Here's what we understand (because we've lived it):

By 8pm, you've got nothing left.

The last thing you need is another strategy that requires your energy, your focus, your patience.

11/ That's why "just press play" matters.

No behaviour charts.
No reward systems.
No guided meditation you have to supervise.

Press play. Walk away. That's it.

12/ Melatonin can help with the delayed circadian rhythm.

But it doesn't help with the racing brain that stays active despite feeling tired.

One without the other often isn't enough.

13/ If this resonated:

Your ADHD child's brain needs somewhere calm to land.

You've already tried harder than most people will ever understand.

Maybe tonight, you don't need another strategy. You need something that works WITHOUT your effort.

14/ We built The Open Sanctuary for exhausted parents of ADHD kids.

Free sounds designed for brains that won't switch off.

No signup. No cost. Just something that actually helps.

RT tweet 1 if you know a parent who needs this.

## Singles

### Single 1: The Relatable Moment

Bath. Story. Same time every night. Blackout blinds. No screens.

And your ADHD child STILL won't sleep.

Here's the thing — every sleep guide was written for a different kind of brain.

Yours isn't broken. It's just not neurotypical.

### Single 2: The Science Stat

73-78% of ADHD children have a delayed sleep/wake cycle.

Their melatonin kicks in ~45 minutes later than neurotypical kids.

When you put them to bed at 8pm, their brain genuinely isn't ready yet.

They're not being defiant. Their body clock is different.

### Single 3: The Mindset Shift

ADHD brains need INPUT to calm down, not just removal of input.

The quieter the room, the louder the brain.

That's why "just relax and sleep" is about as useful as telling someone with a broken leg to "just walk it off."

### Single 4: The Parent Validation

By 8pm, you've got nothing left.

Breakfast battles. School run. Work. Homework. After-school meltdowns. Dinner negotiations.

The last thing you need is another strategy that requires your energy.

You've already tried harder than most people will ever understand.

### Single 5: The Counter-Intuitive Truth

Telling an ADHD child to "just relax and go to sleep" in a quiet, dark room?

You're actually making it harder.

Their brain NEEDS something to land on. Silence creates a vacuum that racing thoughts rush to fill.

Sound isn't a crutch. It's a tool.
