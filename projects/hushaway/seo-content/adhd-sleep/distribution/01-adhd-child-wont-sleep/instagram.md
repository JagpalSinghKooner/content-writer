# Instagram Content: Why Your ADHD Child Won't Sleep

---

## Carousel

### Slide 1 (Hook)

**Text:**
It's 11pm.

Your ADHD child
is still awake.

You've done
everything right.

**(swipe for why)**

**Design Notes:** Bold white text on dark blue/navy gradient. Minimal. One exhausted parent moment captured.

---

### Slide 2

**Text:**
Bath. Story.
Same time every night.
Blackout blinds.
No screens.

Still wide awake.

**Design Notes:** Simple text layout. Create connection with the reader's lived experience.

---

### Slide 3

**Text:**
Here's what nobody
told you:

Every sleep guide
was written for a
different kind of brain.

**Design Notes:** Emphasis on "different kind of brain" — slightly larger or different colour.

---

### Slide 4

**Text:**
The ADHD brain
doesn't have an
"off switch" for thoughts.

When the room goes quiet,
the brain gets LOUDER.

**Design Notes:** Visual contrast between "quiet" and "LOUDER" text.

---

### Slide 5

**Text:**
75% of ADHD children
have sleep problems.

That's not bad parenting.
That's neurobiology.

**Design Notes:** Statistic prominent. The reframe is the key message.

---

### Slide 6

**Text:**
Their melatonin kicks in
45 minutes later
than other children.

When you say "bedtime"
their body says "not yet."

**Design Notes:** Clock visual element optional. Focus on the biological reality.

---

### Slide 7

**Text:**
Standard advice says:
Remove stimulation.

But ADHD brains need
INPUT to calm down,
not just removal of input.

**Design Notes:** Contrast between standard advice and what actually works.

---

### Slide 8

**Text:**
The missing piece?

Passive sound that gives
racing thoughts
somewhere calm to land.

**Design Notes:** This is the solution reveal. Calming visual treatment.

---

### Slide 9

**Text:**
No effort required.
From you or your child.

Press play.
Walk away.
That's it.

**Design Notes:** Simple, relief-focused. The exhausted parent's dream.

---

### Slide 10 (CTA)

**Text:**
You've tried harder
than most people
will ever understand.

Your child's brain just needs
somewhere calm to land.

Try The Open Sanctuary tonight.
Link in bio. Free, forever.

**Design Notes:** Warm, validating close. Clear CTA to The Open Sanctuary.

## Caption

It's 11pm and your ADHD child is still awake.

You've done everything right. Bath. Story. Same time every night. Blackout blinds. No screens.

Still wide awake.

Here's what nobody told you:

Every sleep guide you've followed was written for a different kind of brain.

75% of ADHD children have sleep problems. Not because of bad parenting. Because their brains are wired differently.

The ADHD brain doesn't have an "off switch" for thoughts. When the room goes quiet, the brain gets louder.

Standard advice says remove stimulation. But ADHD brains need INPUT to calm down — not just removal of input.

The missing piece? Passive sound that gives racing thoughts somewhere calm to land.

No effort required. From you or your child.

You've already tried harder than most people will ever understand.

Maybe tonight, your child's brain just needs somewhere calm to land.

Try The Open Sanctuary. Free sounds designed for sensitive and neurodivergent children. Link in bio.

TEXT: "You've done everything right"

---

**The Shift (10-18 seconds):**
[Softer visuals, calmer colours]

VOICEOVER: "Here's what nobody told you. Every sleep guide was written for a different brain. ADHD brains need something TO focus on — not just removal of stimulation."

TEXT: "ADHD brains need INPUT to calm down"

---

**Solution (18-23 seconds):**

**Production Notes:**
- Trending audio optional: soft ambient or piano track that's currently performing well
- Keep visual transitions smooth, not jarring
- Warm colour grading throughout
- Caption on screen for accessibility (80%+ watch without sound)
- Loop potential: end on parent sitting peacefully, connects back to opening
