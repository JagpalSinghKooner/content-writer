## Hook

It's 11pm and you're in tears on the sofa again.

Bath, story, lights out — you've done everything "right." And your child is still wide awake up there, mind racing, calling out for water, asking one more question about space.

Here's what I wish someone had told me years ago: **the problem isn't you.**

Every sleep guide you've ever read was written for a different kind of brain. The "consistent routine" advice, the "cool dark room" tips, the "no screens before bed" rules — they work beautifully for neurotypical children whose brains wind down on cue.

But research shows almost 75% of children with ADHD have sleep problems. Their melatonin kicks in about 45 minutes later than other kids. Their thoughts don't have an "off switch." And the quieter the room gets, the louder their brain becomes.

This isn't a parenting failure. It's neurobiology.

The missing piece? ADHD brains need something calming TO focus on — not just the removal of stimulation. When we take everything away (screens, activity, noise), we leave their brain in a vacuum. And brains fill vacuums. Usually with racing thoughts, anxiety, or endless trips to the toilet.

That's why passive sound works when everything else has failed. Not meditation they need to concentrate on. Just gentle audio that gives their brain somewhere calm to land. Press play, walk away.

You've already tried harder than most people will ever understand. This might be simpler.
