# Pillar Brief: ADHD Sleep

## 1. Strategic Context

**Pillar:** ADHD sleep problems
**Priority:** Critical
**Why now:** 73-85% of ADHD children have sleep problems, yet no UK content exists that's ADHD-specific AND offers passive audio solutions. Parents search desperately ("ADHD child won't sleep") with few good resources. The market is dominated by clinical advice (NHS) and behavioural interventions — no one owns the "sound-based solution" angle. HushAway® can fill this gap immediately.

**Proprietary advantage:** Passive listening that directly addresses the "racing ADHD brain that won't switch off." Unlike competitors offering behavioural advice or meditation requiring engagement, HushAway® delivers zero-effort calming — just press play. The frequency-based sounds and ASMR are designed specifically for neurodivergent children, not adapted from neurotypical content.

## 5. Angle Opportunities

Based on competitor gaps, these angles are available:

1. **"The Missing Piece" (Sound-Based Solutions):** No UK competitor positions audio/sound as primary ADHD sleep solution. Research supports white noise (75dB reducing sleep latency), but this doesn't appear in consumer content. HushAway® can own "what to PLAY to help your ADHD child sleep."

2. **"Zero-Effort for Exhausted Parents":** Competitors offer advice that requires significant parental effort (implementing routines, environmental changes, bedtime behaviour protocols). Position passive listening as the solution for parents too exhausted for complex interventions. "Just press play."

3. **"Why Generic Sleep Advice Doesn't Work for ADHD":** NHS content is comprehensive but generic. Position HushAway® content as ADHD-specific — explaining WHY the racing brain problem requires different solutions than typical sleep hygiene.

4. **"Parent-to-Parent, Not Clinical":** NHS dominates authority but uses clinical language. The ADHD Centre is friendlier but still clinical. Position HushAway® as warm, empathetic, peer voice — "we've been there too."

5. **"UK-Specific Guidance":** Most accessible content is US-based (CHADD, ADDitude). Position as definitively UK — UK English, UK research, UK context (NHS pathways, melatonin guidelines).

**Recommended starting angle:** "The Missing Piece" — Position sound-based solutions as what's missing from current ADHD sleep guidance. All articles should weave in passive listening as the differentiator.

         +-- [#1 Why Your ADHD Child Won't Sleep] ←→ [#4 Racing Thoughts at Bedtime]
         |         |

```

**Linking rules for this pillar:**
- Every article links to pillar guide (after pillar published)
- Article 1 links to Articles 2 and 4 (problem → routine → racing thoughts progression)
- Article 3 links to Article 5 (sounds as non-medication alternative)
- Article 6 links to both Article 1 and Autistic Meltdowns pillar (when created)
- Pillar guide links to all supporting articles

**Link Timing:**

| Link Type | When Added |
|-----------|------------|
| Links TO pillar guide | After pillar guide published (Article 7) |
| Links BETWEEN supporting articles | During writing if target exists, otherwise use placeholder |
| Links FROM pillar guide | During pillar guide writing (all supporting articles exist) |

**Placeholder convention:** When an article needs to link to content that doesn't exist yet:
```html
<!-- LINK NEEDED: [slug] when published -->
```

**Post-pillar linking pass:** After pillar guide publishes, replace all placeholders with actual links and add links TO the pillar guide from all supporting articles.

## 7. Publishing Order

| Order | Article | Depends On | Notes |
|-------|---------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Why Your ADHD Child Won't Sleep | None | Foundation — validates problem, introduces sound solution |
| 2 | ADHD Bedtime Routine That Actually Works | #1 | Practical follow-up to "why" article |
| 3 | Best Calming Sounds for ADHD Children | #1 | Commercial intent, direct product relevance |
| 4 | Racing Thoughts at Bedtime | #1 | Dives deeper into the mechanism #1 introduces |
| 5 | Beyond Melatonin: Non-Medication Sleep Help | #3, #4 | Positions sounds alongside other alternatives |
| 6 | ADHD Sleep vs Autism Sleep | #1 | Addresses comorbidity audience |
| 7 | Complete Guide to ADHD Sleep Problems (Pillar) | All above | Publishes last — links to all, comprehensive authority piece |

**Dependency types:**
- **Content:** #1 establishes foundational concepts all other articles reference
- **Linking:** #3 and #4 must exist before #5 can link to them
- **Strategic:** Pillar guide last because it links to all supporting articles — those must exist first

## Key Win Strategy

HushAway® wins this pillar by:

1. **Owning the sound solution space** — Be THE resource explaining which sounds help ADHD children sleep and why
2. **Speaking parent-to-parent** — Not clinical, not preachy, just one exhausted parent sharing what works
3. **Positioning passive listening** — "Just press play" as the solution for exhausted parents
4. **UK-specific authority** — UK English, UK research (DISCA study, Southampton), UK context
5. **Validating then solving** — Every article starts with validation ("we know this is hard") before offering solutions

**The gap:** No UK competitor combines ADHD sleep expertise with sound-based solutions and parent-friendly voice. HushAway® fills all three.
