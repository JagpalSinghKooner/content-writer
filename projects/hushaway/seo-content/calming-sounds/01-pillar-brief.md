# Pillar Brief: Calming Sounds for Children

## 1. Strategic Context

**Pillar:** Calming sounds for children
**Priority:** High
**Why now:** Direct product category with commercial intent. Pillars 1-3 (ADHD Sleep, Autistic Meltdowns, Sensory Overload) established the "why" (problems ND children face). This pillar captures the "what" (parents searching for the solution). High search volume, clear purchase intent, and HushAway's 22+ sound formats give unmatched differentiation.
**Proprietary advantage:** Only UK provider with neurodivergent-first design AND passive listening approach. Competitors either require interaction (Moshi, Calm, Headspace) or are generic (CBeebies, YouTube). HushAway is built from the ground up for ND children with zero-demand audio.

### Moshi Kids (moshikids.com)
- **DR Estimate:** 60-70
- **Angle:** Character-driven entertainment meets bedtime. BAFTA award-winning, Moshi Monsters IP.
- **Strengths:** 400+ audio stories, NYU research (28 min faster sleep, 50% fewer wakings), 6.8M reviews, established brand.

### Calm Kids (calm.com/app/kids)

- **Angle:** Celebrity narration meets mainstream mindfulness. Part of #1 global meditation app.
- **Strengths:** P!nk, Maya Rudolph narration. Massive brand recognition. Integrated with adult Calm app.
- **Gaps:** NO ND-specific content. Generic children's meditation. Requires engagement with app. Premium pricing.

### Headspace for Kids (headspace.com/meditation/kids)
- **DR Estimate:** 80-85
- **Angle:** Developmental psychology meets meditation. Age-stratified content.
- **Strengths:** Clear age groupings (3-5, 6-8, 9-12). Evidence-informed approach. Founder credibility (Andy Puddicombe).
- **Gaps:** NO ND-specific content. US-focused. Requires following guided instructions. Not passive listening.

### CBeebies Radio Calming Sounds (BBC)
- **DR Estimate:** 95+
- **Angle:** Public service, free accessibility. BBC trust.
- **Strengths:** FREE and ad-free. 8 sound options. Expert-endorsed (audiologist, psychologist). Massive reach.

## 4. Content Plan

### Article 01: Why Generic Calming Sounds Don't Work for ND Children (PRIORITY: Do First)
- **Target keyword:** calming sounds for ADHD child, calming sounds for autistic child
- **Secondary keywords:** sounds for neurodivergent children, calming sounds sensitive child
- **Content type:** Problem-aware educational (why generic fails)
- **Word count:** 1,800-2,200
- **Angle opportunity:** "Designed FOR vs adapted FOR" — explains why sounds made for neurotypical children miss the mark. Positions ND-first design as the solution.
- **Why first:** Foundation article. Explains the problem before offering solutions. Creates demand for ND-specific content.

### Article 02: Sleep Sounds for Children: Which Type Actually Helps
- **Target keyword:** sleep sounds for children
- **Secondary keywords:** bedtime sounds kids, night time sounds child, sounds to help child sleep
- **Content type:** How-to guide (commercial intent)
- **Word count:** 2,000-2,500
- **Angle opportunity:** Match sound type to sleep problem. Not all sleep issues need the same sound. Racing brain needs X, sensory sensitivity needs Y.
- **Why second:** High commercial intent. Parents searching for "sleep sounds" are ready to try something. Conversion driver.

### Article 03: ASMR, Binaural Beats, White Noise: A Parent's Guide to Sound Types
- **Target keyword:** ASMR for children
- **Secondary keywords:** binaural beats for kids, white noise child, brown noise sleep kids, pink noise for children
- **Content type:** Comparison guide
- **Word count:** 2,500-3,000
- **Angle opportunity:** Evidence-based clarity. What the research actually shows. No other UK content explains binaural beats safety for children or ASMR effectiveness honestly.
- **Why third:** Fills MASSIVE content gap. Parents are searching for these terms with no UK guidance. Positions HushAway as trusted expert.

### Article 04: Calming Sounds for Every Situation
- **Target keyword:** sounds for anxious child
- **Secondary keywords:** sounds for focus child, sounds for transitions child, calming sounds for car journeys
- **Content type:** Listicle (situation-based)
- **Word count:** 2,000-2,400
- **Angle opportunity:** Practical matching. "For this situation, try this sound." Fills the "what to play" gap identified in previous pillars.
- **Why fourth:** Extends the "what to play" angle from Meltdowns pillar. Shows HushAway's range.

### Article 05: Free Calming Sounds for Children UK
- **Target keyword:** free calming sounds for kids UK
- **Secondary keywords:** free sleep sounds children, free relaxation sounds kids
- **Content type:** Listicle (transactional)
- **Word count:** 1,500-1,800
- **Angle opportunity:** Open Sanctuary positioning. Lists options (including CBeebies, YouTube) but positions Open Sanctuary as the ND-first free option.
- **Why fifth:** Captures transactional "free" searches. Direct conversion to Open Sanctuary.

### Article 06: Calming Sounds vs Music: What's the Difference?
- **Target keyword:** calming sounds vs music children
- **Secondary keywords:** difference white noise pink noise, sounds or music for child sleep
- **Content type:** Comparison (informational)
- **Word count:** 1,500-1,800
- **Angle opportunity:** Education. Why sounds work differently than music for regulation. When to use each.
- **Why sixth:** Lower priority but fills informational gap. Builds topical authority.

### Pillar Article 07: The Complete Guide to Calming Sounds for Children (PUBLISH LAST)
- **Target keyword:** calming sounds for children
- **Secondary keywords:** relaxing sounds for kids, soothing sounds child, best calming sounds for kids
- **Content type:** Comprehensive pillar guide

## 5. Angle Opportunities

Based on competitor gaps, these angles are available:

1. **"Designed FOR, not adapted FOR"** — Every competitor either adapts adult content for kids (Calm, Headspace) or adapts generic kids content for ND (Moshi). HushAway is the ONLY platform built from the ground up for neurodivergent children.

2. **"Passive listening: zero-demand calming"** — Moshi, Calm, and Headspace all require interaction (selecting content, following instructions). HushAway's passive listening means press play and done. This matters most when children (and parents) are overwhelmed.

3. **"Evidence-based clarity"** — Parents search for binaural beats, ASMR, frequencies with no trusted UK guidance. HushAway can fill this gap by explaining what the research actually shows (including honest limitations).

4. **"The sound library, not the sound"** — Competitors offer single sounds or limited options. HushAway's 22+ formats (ASMR, frequencies, binaural, stories, ambient) means parents find what works for THEIR child.

5. **"Free ND-first sounds"** — CBeebies is free but generic. Open Sanctuary is free AND neurodivergent-first. Only option in market with both.

**Recommended primary angle:** "Designed FOR, not adapted FOR" — This differentiates from all competitors and explains why HushAway exists.

**Placeholder convention:** When an article needs to link to content that doesn't exist yet:
```html
<!-- LINK NEEDED: [slug] when published -->
```

**Post-pillar linking pass:** After pillar guide publishes, replace all placeholders with actual links and add links TO the pillar guide from all supporting articles.
