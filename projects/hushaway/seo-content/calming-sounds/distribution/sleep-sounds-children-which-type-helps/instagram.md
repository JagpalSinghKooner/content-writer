# Instagram Content: Sleep Sounds for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
"TRY WHITE NOISE"

isn't helpful when it's your
fourth app tonight

[Bold text, high contrast - parent exhaustion visual]

### Slide 2: The Problem
Most parents cycle through sounds at random

White noise
Rain sounds
Ocean waves

Nothing works

Here's why ↓

### Slide 3: You're Missing the Match
Your child's sleep problem has a shape

The right sound matches that shape

Not their friend's problem
Not the average child's problem

THEIR specific barrier to sleep

### Slide 4: Racing Brain
Signs:
→ Asks questions when settling
→ Mentions worries
→ Eyes stay alert

Needs:
Layered soundscapes with gentle variation

NOT:
Silence, static sounds, guided meditations

### Slide 5: Sensory Sensitivity
Signs:
→ Covers ears at sounds others miss
→ Hears everything
→ Certain sounds cause discomfort

Needs:
Carefully calibrated frequencies

NOT:
Generic sleep sounds

### Slide 6: Transition Anxiety
Signs:
→ Wants you to stay
→ Delays bedtime
→ Struggles before sleep

Needs:
Continuous audio with no endings

NOT:
Sounds that stop suddenly

### Slide 7: Environmental Sensitivity
Signs:
→ Reacts to household sounds
→ Comments on noises outside
→ Settles better on quiet nights

Needs:
Masking sounds (brown or pink noise)

NOT:
Complete silence, sounds with gaps

### Slide 8: How to Test
Give each sound type
3 CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS
before deciding

The nervous system needs time to build the association

One night isn't enough data

### Slide 9: The Truth
If you've tried app after app without success...

Maybe nothing is wrong with your child

Maybe the sounds have been designed for someone else's brain

### Slide 10: CTA
Your child's sleep problem has a shape

The right sound matches that shape

Fourth app. Third playlist. Second meltdown.

.
.
.

You've tried the white noise. The rain sounds. Every "relaxing bedtime sounds" option the app store threw at you. And your child is still wide awake.

Here's what nobody tells you: there's no universal "best" sound. The sound that finally works is the one that matches your child's specific sleep problem.

A racing brain needs different audio than sensory sensitivity. Transition anxiety requires something different again. Once you understand the match, bedtime sounds kids actually respond to become possible to find.

**The four sleep barriers:**

Racing brain: Layered soundscapes with gentle variation. Gives the brain something to follow without demanding attention.

Sensory sensitivity: Carefully calibrated sounds with controlled frequency ranges. No harsh frequencies that trigger sensitive ears.

Transition anxiety: Gentle, continuous audio that bridges the gap. No clear endings. Presence without expectation.

Environmental sensitivity: Masking sounds that cover external noise. Brown or pink noise often better than white noise.

**How to find the match:**

Tonight, watch your child at bedtime. Really watch. Listen to what they say. Notice what happens. Then choose sounds designed for their specific barrier.

Give each sound type at least three consecutive nights before deciding. Your child's nervous system needs time to build the association.

For sounds designed specifically for sensitive and neurodivergent children, explore The Open Sanctuary at HushAway®. No interaction required. Just press play.

Because the goal isn't finding the best sleep sounds for children. The goal is finding the right sleep sounds for your child.

Match the sound to the problem. Test for three nights. Watch what changes."
