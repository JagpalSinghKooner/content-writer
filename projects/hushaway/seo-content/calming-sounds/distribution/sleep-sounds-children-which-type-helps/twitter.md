# Twitter/X Content: Sleep Sounds for Children

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
"Try white noise" isn't helpful advice when it's your fourth app and your child is still wide awake.

Your child's sleep problem has a shape. The right sound matches that shape.

Here's how to find the match:

🧵 Thread:

### Tweet 2
1. RACING BRAIN

The child who can't switch off. Lies in bed replaying the day, worrying about tomorrow.

25-50% of children with ADHD struggle with this nightly.

What works: Layered soundscapes with gentle variation. Gives the brain something to follow without demanding attention.

### Tweet 3
2. SENSORY SENSITIVITY

The child who covers their ears at sounds others barely notice. Can hear the fridge humming two rooms away.

Research shows 80% of autistic children experience sleep disturbances and sensory sensitivities together.

What works: Carefully calibrated sounds with controlled frequency ranges.

3. TRANSITION ANXIETY

Bedtime isn't just about sleep. It's about leaving the day behind. Being alone in the dark.

For anxious children, these transitions are genuinely frightening.

What works: Gentle, continuous audio. No clear endings. Low, steady tones that create a sense of being held.

### Tweet 5
4. ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVITY

This child can't settle because of what they hear around them. Traffic. Neighbours. The house settling.

Every sound resets the settling process.

What works: Masking sounds. Brown or pink noise often better than white noise. Consistent, enveloping audio.

### Tweet 6
Most parents have been cycling through sounds at random.

White noise. Rain sounds. Ocean waves.

Nothing works.

Here's why: you're trying sounds designed for different problems than the one your child actually has.

### Tweet 7
The shift:

Stop guessing. Start observing.

Watch your child at bedtime tonight. Really watch. Listen to what they say. Notice what happens.

Then choose sounds designed for THAT specific barrier.

### Tweet 8
Testing rule:

Give each sound type at least 3 consecutive nights before deciding.

Your child's nervous system needs time to recognise the sound as safe and associated with sleep.

One night isn't enough data.

### Tweet 9
When sounds don't work alone:

Also consider timing (circadian rhythms vary), environment (light, temperature, textures), routine (predictable sequences), and the day (processing overwhelm from hours ago).

Sounds work best as part of a thoughtful whole.

### Tweet 10 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Racing brain → Layered soundscapes
• Sensory sensitivity → Calibrated frequencies
• Transition anxiety → Continuous audio
• Environmental sensitivity → Masking sounds

Match sound to problem. Test for 3 nights. Observe what works.

The right sound for your child exists.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Stop cycling through sleep sounds at random.

Most parents try: white noise, rain, ocean waves.

But a racing brain needs different audio than sensory sensitivity.

Once you match sound to your child's specific sleep barrier, bedtime changes.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

"Try white noise" is lazy advice.

It assumes all children struggle with sleep for the same reason.

They don't.

A child with a racing brain needs completely different sounds than a child with sensory sensitivity.

### Tweet C (List)
4 sleep barriers that need different sounds:

• Racing brain → layered soundscapes
• Sensory sensitivity → calibrated frequencies
• Transition anxiety → continuous audio
• Environmental sensitivity → masking sounds

Which one is your child?

### Tweet D (Proof)
After watching hundreds of families:

Generic sleep sounds work for some children.

But if your child isn't one of them, you need sounds designed for how their brain actually works.

Not adapted from neurotypical content. Built from the ground up.

### Tweet E (Question)
You've tried white noise. Rain sounds. Every "relaxing bedtime sounds" app.

Still not working?

Genuine question: what happens when you watch your child at bedtime? What do they say? What do you notice?

The answer tells you which sound type to try next.
