# Newsletter Snippet: Sleep Sounds for Children

## Hook

Fourth app. Third playlist. Second meltdown. You've tried white noise, rain sounds, and every "relaxing bedtime sounds" option the app store could offer. And your child is still wide awake, staring at the ceiling.

## Body

Here's what nobody tells you about sleep sounds for children: there's no universal "best" sound. The sound that finally works is the one that matches your child's specific sleep problem.

A racing brain needs different audio than sensory sensitivity. Transition anxiety requires something different again. Most parents have been cycling through sounds at random, hoping something sticks. That approach can work eventually, but it's exhausting.

There's a better way. We've identified four primary sleep barriers, and each one responds to a different type of audio. Racing brain children need layered soundscapes with gentle variation. Sensory-sensitive children need carefully calibrated frequencies. Children with transition anxiety need continuous audio with no clear endings. And environmentally sensitive children need masking sounds like brown or pink noise.

The key is observation. Tonight, watch your child at bedtime. Really watch. Listen to what they say. Notice what happens. That tells you which sound type to try. Then give it at least three consecutive nights before deciding. The nervous system needs time to build the association.

## CTA

Your child's sleep problem has a shape. The right sound matches that shape.

**This week:** Why "try white noise" isn't helpful advice

Most parents have tried every sleep sound app on their phone. White noise. Rain sounds. Ocean waves. Nothing works.

Here's why: your child's sleep problem has a shape, and the right sound matches that shape.

Learn how to identify your child's specific sleep barrier and choose sounds designed for it:

• Racing brain → Layered soundscapes with gentle variation
• Sensory sensitivity → Carefully calibrated frequencies
• Transition anxiety → Continuous audio with no endings
• Environmental sensitivity → Masking sounds
