# LinkedIn Content: Sleep Sounds for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
"Try white noise" isn't helpful advice.

Your child's sleep problem has a shape.

The right sound matches that shape.

Swipe → to find the match

### Slide 2: The Real Problem
Most parents cycle through sounds at random.

White noise. Rain sounds. Ocean waves. Every "relaxing bedtime sounds" option.

Nothing works.

Here's why: you're trying sounds designed for different problems.

### Slide 3: Problem One - Racing Brain
**Signs:**
- Asks questions when settling
- Mentions worries or thoughts
- Eyes stay alert despite tiredness

**What works:**
Layered soundscapes with subtle variation. Gives the brain something to follow without demanding attention.

**What doesn't:**
Silence, static sounds, guided meditations that add cognitive load.

### Slide 4: Problem Two - Sensory Sensitivity
**Signs:**
- Covers ears at sounds others miss
- Can hear the fridge two rooms away
- Certain frequencies cause discomfort

**What works:**
Carefully calibrated sounds with controlled frequency ranges. No harsh frequencies that trigger sensitive ears.

**What doesn't:**
Generic sleep sounds not calibrated for auditory hypersensitivity.

### Slide 5: Problem Three - Transition Anxiety
**Signs:**
- Wants you to stay
- Delays bedtime with requests
- Struggles in moments before sleep

**What works:**
Gentle, continuous audio that bridges the gap. No clear endings. Presence without expectation.

**What doesn't:**
Sounds that stop suddenly. Tracks with clear endings. High-frequency activating sounds.

### Slide 6: Problem Four - Environmental Sensitivity
**Signs:**
- Reacts to household sounds
- Comments on noises from outside
- Settles better on quieter nights

**What works:**
Masking sounds that cover environmental noise. Brown or pink noise often better than white noise.

**What doesn't:**
Complete silence. Sounds with gaps. Masking sounds that are themselves uncomfortable.

### Slide 7: How to Test Thoughtfully
Most parents try a sound for one night and move on.

Your child's nervous system needs time to recognise the sound as safe.

**The rule:** Three consecutive nights minimum before deciding.

If something makes things worse, stop immediately.

If something seems neutral, continue the full three nights.

### Slide 8: When Sounds Aren't Enough
Sounds are one part of the sleep puzzle.

Also consider:
- Timing (circadian rhythms vary)
- Environment (light, temperature, textures)
- Routine (predictable sequences)
- The day (processing overwhelm from hours ago)

Sounds work best as part of a thoughtful whole.

### Slide 9: The Match Exists
If you've tried app after app without success, maybe nothing is wrong with your child.

Maybe the sounds have just been designed for someone else's brain.

The right sound matches your child's specific sleep barrier.

Finding it takes observation and patience. But it exists.

Fourth app. Third playlist. Second meltdown.

Sound familiar?

Here's what nobody tells you about sleep sounds for children: there's no universal "best" sound.

A racing brain needs different audio than sensory sensitivity. Transition anxiety requires something different again.

Here's how to match sound to problem:

**Racing brain:**
Look for layered soundscapes with gentle variation. The brain needs something to follow without demanding attention. Static sounds like basic white noise aren't engaging enough.

**Sensory sensitivity:**
Choose carefully calibrated sounds with controlled frequency ranges. Generic sleep sounds weren't created with auditory hypersensitivity in mind. Frequency combinations that feel neutral to most ears can land as sharp to sensitive processing.

**Transition anxiety:**
Use gentle, continuous audio that bridges the gap. No clear endings. Low, steady tones that create a sense of being held. Sounds that stop suddenly create a moment of "now I'm alone."

**Environmental sensitivity:**
Try masking sounds that cover external noise. Brown or pink noise often work better than white noise. Consistent, enveloping audio that fills the space.

The key? Identify your child's primary barrier first. Watch them at bedtime. Notice what happens. Then choose sounds designed for that specific challenge.

Give each sound type at least three consecutive nights before deciding. The nervous system needs time to build the association.

Your child's sleep problem has a shape. The right sound matches that shape.

For sounds designed specifically for sensitive and neurodivergent children, explore The Open Sanctuary at HushAway®.

Because the goal isn't finding the best sleep sounds for children. The goal is finding the right sleep sounds for your child.

"Have you tried white noise?"

If I had a pound for every time I've heard this advice.

The problem? It assumes all children struggle with sleep for the same reason.

They don't.

After working with hundreds of families of sensitive and neurodivergent children, we've seen clear patterns. Most sleep difficulties fall into four categories, and each one responds to a different type of audio.

**The four barriers:**

1. Racing brain (can't switch off thoughts)
2. Sensory sensitivity (certain frequencies cause discomfort)
3. Transition anxiety (fear of being alone, losing consciousness)
4. Environmental sensitivity (household sounds break through)

White noise might help environmental sensitivity. But it does nothing for a racing brain. Rain sounds might feel calming to some nervous systems, but actively irritating to others.

Here's the shift: stop cycling through sounds at random. Instead, observe your child at bedtime. Really watch. Listen to what they say. Notice what happens.

Then choose sounds designed for their specific barrier.

Research from the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine shows sleep difficulties in children have multiple distinct causes. A child lying awake because their brain won't stop racing has a completely different challenge than a child who can't tolerate the silence of their bedroom.

The same night time sounds children respond to differently because their barriers are different.

Once you understand the match, bedtime sounds kids actually respond to become possible to find.

For sounds designed from the ground up for sensitive and neurodivergent children, explore The Open Sanctuary at HushAway®. No interaction required. Just press play.

Because when sounds match the problem, bedtime changes.
