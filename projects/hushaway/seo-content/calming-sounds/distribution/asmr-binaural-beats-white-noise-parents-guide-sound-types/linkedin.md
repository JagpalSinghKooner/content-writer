### Slide 1: Hook
ASMR for children safe?
Binaural beats for kids?
White noise or brown noise?

You've Googled it all at 11pm.
Here's what the research actually shows.

### Slide 2: ASMR for Children
What it is: Gentle sounds like whispering, tapping, soft speech

What research shows: Adults experience measurable heart rate reduction (Sheffield University, 2018)

But: Most studies focus on adults, not children

Bottom line: Safe when age-appropriate. Your child's response matters more than any generalisation.

### Slide 3: Who ASMR Works For
Children who respond well:
• Find whispering soothing (not irritating)
• Like predictable, repetitive sounds
• Struggle with silence
• Find music too stimulating

It's about matching sound to brain, not forcing what's "supposed" to work.

### Slide 4: Binaural Beats
How they work: Different frequency in each ear creates third "beat" your brain perceives

The promise: Brain entrains to relaxation/focus frequencies

The reality: Research is mixed. Some studies show benefits. Others show no effect vs placebo.

Honest answer: Might help. Might not. Worth trying if your child tolerates headphones.

### Slide 5: Safety Notes for Binaural Beats
🎧 Requires headphones (barrier for some children)

⚠️ Caution if epilepsy/seizure history

🔊 Volume matters—conversation level max

💭 Set expectations: "Let's try this" not "This will definitely work"

### Slide 6: Noise Colours Explained
White noise: All frequencies equally (TV static, harsh)

Pink noise: Lower frequencies emphasised (rainfall, gentler)

Brown noise: Deep low rumble (distant thunder, grounding)

Same masking principle. Different sensory feel.

### Slide 7: Which Colour for Which Child
Sound sensitivity? → Pink or brown (warmer, less harsh)

Racing brain at bedtime? → Brown noise or ASMR

Environmental noise issues? → White or pink (strong masking)

Finds silence uncomfortable? → ASMR or pink

Each child different. Watch their response.

### Slide 8: What We Don't Know Yet
Long-term effects on children
Why some respond, others don't
Direct comparison between sound types
Neurodivergent-specific research

Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of harm.
But honesty about limitations matters.

### Slide 9: The Real Answer
There's no "best" sound.

Only the right match for your child's brain, sensitivities, and challenges.

Generic calming sounds fail because they weren't designed for sensitive or neurodivergent children.

Finding the match is what changes things.

### Slide 10: CTA
At HushAway®, we create sounds specifically for sensitive and neurodivergent children.

ASMR. Frequencies. Binaural beats. Unique combinations.

All passive listening. Just press play.

It's 10:47pm. Your child still won't settle.

You've Googled "ASMR for children safe." Then "binaural beats for kids." Then "white noise child sleep."

And you've walked away more confused than when you started.

Here's why:

Most content about these sound types falls into two unhelpful categories. Either it's written by audio companies trying to sell you something, or it's so clinical you need a neuroscience degree to understand it.

Neither helps you right now, standing in the kitchen, wondering what to play for a child who won't settle.

So here's the honest picture:

**ASMR for children:**
Research shows measurable benefits in adults (heart rate reduction, positive emotions). But most studies focus on adults. For children, we have growing anecdotal evidence—it works brilliantly for some, not at all for others. Safety isn't the concern. Match is.

**Binaural beats:**
Theory: brain entrains to specific frequencies for relaxation or focus. Reality: research is mixed. Some studies show benefits. Others show no significant effect vs placebo. Requires headphones. Avoid if seizure history. Worth trying, but manage expectations.

**White, pink, brown noise:**
All provide masking of environmental disruptions. White is harsh and bright. Pink is gentler (reduced high frequencies). Brown is warm and grounding. Children with sound sensitivity often prefer pink or brown. Strong evidence for masking benefits in adults; less research on children specifically.

The limitations matter:
We don't have large-scale studies on long-term effects for children. We don't have neurodivergent-specific research. We don't have direct comparisons between sound types.

But that doesn't mean these sounds don't help.

It means you try them with appropriate expectations. You observe your child's actual response. You make decisions based on what works for your specific family.

The search for calming sounds isn't about finding the "best" sound. It's about finding the right match for your child's brain, their sensitivities, their specific challenges.

At HushAway®, we create sounds specifically for sensitive and neurodivergent children. ASMR, frequencies, binaural beats, and unique combinations called Kaleidoscopes. All designed for passive listening. No interaction required. Just press play.

If you want to explore what might work for your child, The Open Sanctuary offers a curated selection of sounds designed for children like yours.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

Unpopular opinion:

Telling parents that binaural beats "definitely work" for children is marketing, not honesty.

Here's what the research actually shows:

A 2017 systematic review in Frontiers in Psychiatry examined multiple studies on binaural beat efficacy.

The findings? Mixed.

Some studies showed benefits for anxiety reduction and focus. Others showed no significant effect compared to placebo or regular music.

The researchers' conclusion: "While some positive effects exist, evidence is inconsistent and study quality varies considerably."

So why do some families swear by binaural beats while others see zero change?

Because individual response varies. Massively.

What works for one child's brain might do nothing for another's. And that's not a failure—it's neurology.

The same applies to ASMR. To white noise. To pink noise. To brown noise. To every sound type parents search for at midnight when their child won't settle.

There is no universal solution.

Only the right match for your specific child.

At HushAway®, we don't claim any sound type "definitely works." We offer multiple types—ASMR, frequencies, binaural beats, noise colours, combinations—because different children need different sounds.

Our approach: create a library designed for neurodivergent and sensitive children. Let parents explore. Let children respond. Watch what actually works instead of what's "supposed" to work.

The Open Sanctuary gives you access to try different sound types. No commitment. No pressure. Just observation.

Because the best sound for your child is the one they actually respond to.
