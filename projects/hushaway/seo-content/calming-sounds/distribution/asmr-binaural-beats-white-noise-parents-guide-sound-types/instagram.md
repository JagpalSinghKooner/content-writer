# Instagram Content: ASMR for Children Guide

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
ASMR for children?
Binaural beats for kids?
White noise or brown?

The honest parent's guide
to sound types that help

### Slide 2: You've Googled It
10:47pm

"ASMR for children safe"
"binaural beats for kids"
"white noise child sleep"

And walked away
more confused
than when you started

### Slide 3: ASMR — What It Is
Gentle sounds:
whispering, tapping,
soft speech

Research: Reduces heart rate
in adults (Sheffield Uni, 2018)

Gap: Most studies focus
on adults, not children

### Slide 4: ASMR — Who It Helps
Children who:
✓ Find whispering soothing
✓ Like predictable sounds
✓ Struggle with silence
✓ Find music too stimulating

Your child's response
matters more than
any generalisation

### Slide 5: Binaural Beats
The promise:
Brain entrains to
relaxation frequencies

The reality:
Research is mixed

Some studies show benefits
Others show no effect

Worth trying
Manage expectations

### Slide 6: Safety Notes
Binaural beats:
🎧 Needs headphones
⚠️ Caution if epilepsy
🔊 Keep volume low

"Let's try this"
not
"This will definitely work"

### Slide 7: Noise Colours
WHITE
All frequencies
(harsh, bright)

PINK
Lower frequencies
(gentler on ears)

BROWN
Deep rumble
(warm, grounding)

### Slide 8: Which Colour?
Sound sensitivity?
→ Pink or brown

Racing brain?
→ Brown or ASMR

Environmental noise?
→ White or pink

Finds silence uncomfortable?
→ ASMR or pink

### Slide 9: What We Don't Know
Long-term effects?
Why some respond,
others don't?

Most research:
adults, not children

Honesty about limitations
matters

### Slide 10: The Real Answer
No "best" sound
for all children

Only the right match
for YOUR child's brain

Generic sounds fail
because they weren't
designed for ND children

HushAway® was.

### Slide 11: CTA
Sounds designed for
sensitive & neurodivergent
children

ASMR • Frequencies

## Caption

It's 10:47pm. Your child still won't settle. You've Googled "ASMR for children safe." Then "binaural beats for kids." Then "white noise child sleep."

And you've walked away more confused than when you started.

.
.
.

Here's why most content about these sound types doesn't help. It's either audio companies selling you something, or clinical research so dense you need a neuroscience degree to understand it. Neither tells you what to play for your child tonight.

So here's the honest picture:

**ASMR:** Research shows benefits in adults (heart rate reduction). Most studies focus on adults, not children. Safe when age-appropriate. Your child's response matters more than any generalisation.

**Binaural beats:** Mixed research. Some studies show benefits, others show no effect vs placebo. Requires headphones. Worth trying with caution. Manage expectations.

**Noise colours:** White is harsh, pink is gentler, brown is warm. All mask environmental noise. Children with sound sensitivity often prefer pink or brown.

The limitations matter. We don't have large-scale studies on long-term effects for children. We don't have neurodivergent-specific research. But that doesn't mean these sounds don't help. It means you try them with appropriate expectations and watch your child's actual response.

The search for calming sounds isn't about finding the "best" sound. It's about finding the right match for your child's brain, their sensitivities, their specific challenges.

At HushAway®, we create sounds specifically for sensitive and neurodivergent children. ASMR, frequencies, binaural beats, and unique combinations. All designed for passive listening. No interaction required. Just press play.

Explore The Open Sanctuary (link in bio) to find what works for your child.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Stop Googling 'ASMR for children safe' at midnight. Here's what the research actually shows."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"ASMR: Works for some children, not others. Research mostly on adults.

Binaural beats: Mixed evidence. Requires headphones. Worth trying, manage expectations.

Noise colours: White is harsh, pink is gentler, brown is grounding. Choose based on sensory profile.

The truth? There's no 'best' sound. Only the right match for YOUR child's brain."
