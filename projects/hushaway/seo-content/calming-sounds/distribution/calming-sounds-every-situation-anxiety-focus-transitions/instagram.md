# Instagram Content: Calming Sounds for Every Situation

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
THE BEDTIME SOUND
THAT FAILS AT
HOMEWORK TIME

Why one sound doesn't work for every situation

### Slide 2: The Problem
Your child's nervous system isn't in the same state all day.

An anxious brain needs different support than a distracted brain.

### Slide 3: For Anxiety
RACING THOUGHTS?
TUMMY ACHES?

Try:
• Brown noise
• Gentle rain
• Low frequency tones

Gives the brain a steady anchor without adding overwhelm

### Slide 4: For Focus
HOMEWORK BATTLES?
CAN'T CONCENTRATE?

Try:
• White or pink noise
• Binaural beats (beta range)
• Simple ambient (no lyrics)

Satisfies the brain's craving for stimulation

### Slide 5: For Transitions
MORNING MELTDOWNS?
AFTER-SCHOOL EXPLOSIONS?

Try:
• Gentle sounds that build slowly
• 5-minute warning cues
• Sound already playing when they arrive

Predictability helps the brain prepare

### Slide 6: For Car Journeys
SHORT TRIPS:
Brown noise, nature sounds

LONG TRIPS:
Gentle storytelling, ambient soundscapes

Masks unpredictable road noise

### Slide 7: The Key
Build your sound toolkit BEFORE you need it

When things are calm
When there's space to experiment

Not during the meltdown

### Slide 8: Match the Moment
ANXIETY
→ Simple, repetitive

FOCUS
→ White noise, binaural

TRANSITIONS
→ Gentle, predictable

CREATIVE TIME
→ Minimal ambient

The rain sounds worked perfectly for bedtime. So you tried them for homework. Complete disaster.

Here's what nobody tells you about finding sounds for an anxious child: the same sound that works magic at 8pm can make 4pm homework time worse.

Your child's nervous system isn't in the same state all day. An anxious brain needs something different than a distracted brain. A brain overwhelmed by a transition needs something different again.

So here's how to match the right sound to the right moment:

**For anxiety:** Simple, repetitive sounds. Brown noise, gentle rain, low frequency tones. Give the brain a steady anchor without adding to the processing load.

**For focus:** White or pink noise. Binaural beats. ADHD brains crave stimulation—the right sound satisfies that need without becoming a distraction.

**For transitions:** Gentle sounds that build slowly. Consistent cues. Have sound already playing when they walk in the door. Predictability helps the brain prepare.

**For car journeys:** Short trips need simple sounds. Long trips benefit from gentle storytelling. Both mask unpredictable road noise.

The families who make sound work build their toolkit in advance. When things are calm. When there's space to experiment.

Pick your trickiest moment this week. Match a sound to it. See what changes.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Sometimes it's just about finding the right sound for that moment.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
[Text on screen: "The bedtime sound that FAILS at homework time"]
"The rain sounds worked perfectly for bedtime. So you tried them for homework. Complete disaster."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"Here's why: your child's nervous system isn't in the same state all day.

For anxiety: simple, repetitive sounds—brown noise, gentle rain
For focus: white noise or binaural beats—satisfies the ADHD brain's craving for stimulation
For transitions: gentle sounds that build slowly—predictability helps the brain prepare
For car journeys: depends on duration—short trips need simple, long trips need storytelling

Match the sound to the moment. Not one magic sound for everything."

## Visual Notes

**Carousel Design:**
- Colour palette: Soft blues, gentle greens, warm neutrals (calming, not clinical)
- Fonts: Clean, readable sans-serif. Large text for key points
- Layout: Lots of white space. Not cluttered or overwhelming
- Icons: Simple line icons for each situation type (rain drop for anxiety, book for focus, arrow for transitions, car for journeys)

**Reel B-roll Suggestions:**
- Split screen showing same child at different times of day (calm morning vs focused afternoon vs bedtime)
- Close-up of phone/speaker playing sound
- Visual of sound waves with different patterns for different situations
- Parent and child in calm moment together with sound playing in background

**Overall vibe:** Peaceful, reassuring, practical. Not overwhelming or demanding. The visual itself should feel like a moment of calm.
