# LinkedIn Content: Calming Sounds for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
**Why generic calming sounds fail 9 out of 10 neurodivergent children**

(And what actually works instead)

Swipe → to discover the difference

### Slide 2: The Problem
You've tried everything.

The meditation apps.
The white noise.
The sounds other parents swear by.

Nothing sticks for your child.

Here's why.

### Slide 3: Not Your Child
Most calming sounds weren't designed for neurodivergent children.

They were made for neurotypical brains and hoped to work for everyone.

But your child's brain processes sound differently.

### Slide 4: What ND Children Need
Over 90% of autistic children experience sensory processing differences (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016).

They need sounds that:
• Require nothing (no interaction)
• Have no sensory triggers
• Provide predictable audio
• Ask zero cognitive load

### Slide 5: The Types That Work
Different struggles need different sounds:

**Sleep:** Pink/brown noise, binaural beats
**Anxiety:** Ambient sounds, familiar ASMR
**Focus:** White noise, brainwave frequencies
**Transitions:** Consistent soundscapes

### Slide 6: Designed FOR vs Adapted FOR
Generic apps adapted neurotypical content with a "sensory-friendly" label.

Sounds designed FOR neurodivergent children are built differently from the ground up.

That difference? Parents notice it within days.

### Slide 7: The Research
Background noise improves attention and memory in children who struggle with focus (Soderlund et al., 2016).

ASMR produces measurable physiological calming, including reduced heart rate (Poerio et al., 2018).

The science is clear.

### Slide 8: Quick Recap
✓ Generic sounds fail because they weren't made for ND brains
✓ Different sound types serve different needs
✓ Passive listening works when interaction fails
✓ Sounds designed FOR neurodivergent children make an immediate difference

### Slide 9: What Changes
When sounds match how your child processes audio:

Bedtime shifts from 90 minutes to 20.
Meltdown recovery happens faster.
Homework doesn't require three arguments.
Your whole family finds more peaceful moments.

### Slide 10: CTA
**One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.**

9:47pm. Again.

You've downloaded the apps. Played the white noise. Tried the meditation videos other parents swear by.

Nothing works for your child.

Here's what I want you to know: it's not your child. It's not you.

It's the sounds themselves.

Most calming sounds weren't designed for children like yours. They were made for neurotypical brains and hoped to work for everyone. But neurodivergent children process sound differently.

Over 90% of autistic children experience sensory processing differences (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016). Children with ADHD similarly process sensory input differently than their neurotypical peers.

When your child is overwhelmed, they can't follow instructions. "Close your eyes and imagine..." fails when their nervous system is in fight-or-flight.

They need sounds that require nothing. Press play and done.

The difference between sounds adapted FOR neurodivergent children and sounds designed FOR them from the ground up? Parents notice it within days, not weeks.

When sounds match how your child's brain processes audio, everything changes:
• Bedtime shifts from 90 minutes to 20
• Meltdown recovery happens faster
• Homework doesn't require three arguments
• Transitions become manageable

One mum told me recently: "I didn't believe it would work after everything we'd tried. Within a week, bedtime was different."

That's not magic. It's matching the right sounds to how your child actually processes them.

Have you found sounds that work for your child? I'd love to hear what's helped your family.

The research on background noise and neurodivergent children is genuinely fascinating.

Soderlund et al. (2016) found that background white noise improves attention and memory in children who struggle with focus.

The mechanism? External noise occupies part of the brain's processing capacity, freeing up other parts to focus on the task at hand.

In other words: the "right" amount of noise can help an ADHD brain concentrate better, not worse.

This challenges everything we assume about quiet study environments.

But here's the critical part: not all noise works equally for all children.

White noise helps some children focus.
Pink noise works better for others.
Brown noise resonates with children who find higher frequencies overwhelming.

And for some children, layered soundscapes with frequencies or binaural beats make the difference.

The variety of sound types exists precisely because different children respond to different things.

If generic calming sounds haven't helped your child, that doesn't mean sounds can't help. It often means the sounds weren't designed for how their brain processes audio.

Before concluding that "sounds don't work for us," try sounds specifically designed for neurodivergent children.

The approach is fundamentally different. And for many families who'd given up, that difference changes everything.

What helps your child focus? I'm curious what you've discovered works.

Here's the thing about calming sounds versus calming music:

Music requires cognitive processing. Even calm music has melody, rhythm, harmony, and structure that the brain must decode and interpret.

That processing takes mental energy.

Which is fine when your child has energy to spare. It's a problem when they don't.

Calming sounds work on a more basic level. Consistent background noise or ambient soundscapes don't require the brain to process patterns. They simply create an auditory environment.

For neurodivergent children, this difference becomes critical.

When their nervous system is already working hard, adding the cognitive load of music processing can tip them over. Sounds that ask nothing of them provide support without additional demand.

Music is brilliant for:
• Enjoyment when your child has energy
• Movement and regulation activities
• Creating positive routine associations
• Distraction from uncomfortable situations

Calming sounds work better for:
• Settling to sleep when the brain needs to stop processing
• Recovering from overwhelm when cognitive capacity is depleted
• Background support during focus tasks
• Moments when any demand feels like too much

The honest answer? You'll need to observe your child to see what helps when.

But understanding the difference between sounds and music gives you a framework for experimenting.

Every child is different. Yours knows best what works for their body and brain.

What have you noticed about music versus sounds for your child?
