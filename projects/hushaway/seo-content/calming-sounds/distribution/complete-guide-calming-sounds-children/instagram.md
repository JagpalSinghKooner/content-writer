# Instagram Content: Calming Sounds for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
**Why generic calming sounds fail neurodivergent children**

(And what actually works)

[Bold text, high contrast - calming colour palette]

### Slide 2: You've Tried Everything
You've downloaded the apps.

Played the white noise.

Tried the meditation videos.

Nothing sticks for your child.

It's not you. It's the sounds.

### Slide 3: The Problem
Most calming sounds weren't designed for neurodivergent children.

They were made for neurotypical brains.

But ND children process sound differently.

### Slide 4: What ND Children Need
✓ Sounds that require nothing
✓ No sensory triggers
✓ Predictable audio
✓ Zero cognitive load

When your child is overwhelmed, they can't follow instructions.

They need press play and done.

### Slide 5: Sleep Sounds
**Racing brain at bedtime:**
Pink or brown noise

**Sensory sensitivity:**
White noise (masks triggers)

**Transition anxiety:**
ASMR or ambient soundscapes

### Slide 6: Different Needs
**For anxiety:**
Ambient sounds, familiar ASMR

**For focus:**
White noise, brainwave frequencies

**For transitions:**
Consistent soundscapes

Match the sound to the struggle.

### Slide 7: The Research
Background noise improves attention in children who struggle with focus.

ASMR produces measurable physiological calming.

The science backs what parents discover.

### Slide 8: What Changes
When sounds match how your child processes audio:

🌙 Bedtime: 90 minutes → 20 minutes
😌 Meltdown recovery: faster
📚 Homework: no more arguments
🔄 Transitions: manageable

### Slide 9: Parent Quote
"I didn't believe it would work after everything we'd tried.

Within a week, bedtime was different."

That's not magic. It's the right sounds.

### Slide 10: CTA
**One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.**

## Caption

9:47pm. Again.

You've tried everything. The apps, the white noise, the meditation videos other parents swear by. Nothing works for your child.

.

Here's what we want you to know: it's not your child. It's not you. It's the sounds themselves.

Most calming sounds weren't designed for neurodivergent children. They were made for neurotypical brains and hoped to work for everyone. But your child's brain processes sound differently.

Over 90% of autistic children experience sensory processing differences. Children with ADHD process sensory input differently too. When your child is overwhelmed, they can't follow instructions. "Close your eyes and imagine..." fails when their nervous system is in fight-or-flight.

They need sounds that require nothing. Press play and done.

The difference between sounds adapted FOR neurodivergent children and sounds designed FOR them from the ground up? Parents notice it within days. Bedtime shifts from 90 minutes to 20. Meltdown recovery happens faster. Homework doesn't require three arguments.

One mum told us: "I didn't believe it would work after everything we'd tried. Within a week, bedtime was different."

That's not magic. It's matching the right sounds to how your child actually processes them.

Different struggles need different sounds. Sleep needs pink or brown noise. Anxiety responds to ambient sounds and familiar ASMR. Focus improves with white noise or brainwave frequencies. Transitions become manageable with consistent soundscapes.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Let's find what works for yours.
