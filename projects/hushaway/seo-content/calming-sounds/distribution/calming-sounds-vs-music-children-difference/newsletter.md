# Newsletter Snippet: Calming Sounds vs Music for Children

## Hook

Your child's favourite lullaby just failed. Again. Three times tonight, and they're still wide-eyed and wired. Before you try a fourth time, here's something that might change how you think about bedtime entirely.

## Body

When your child hears music, their brain gets busy. Even a simple lullaby activates language processing, memory, motor response, and emotional centres simultaneously. For many children, this is wonderful. Music lifts mood, creates connection, supports learning.

But when your child is already overwhelmed, music adds to the load. Their brain doesn't need more to process. It needs less.

Calming sounds like white noise or pink noise work differently. No melody to follow. No lyrics to decode. No emotional arc to track. Research shows steady-state sounds can support attention and reduce distraction because the brain registers the sound but doesn't have to work on it.

The framework we use at HushAway® is simple: Ask yourself one question. Is my child's brain available right now? If yes (they're regulated, alert), music can enhance the moment. If no (they're tired, overwhelmed, recovering), sounds can support without adding load.

Music isn't wrong. Sounds aren't magic. They're just different tools for different moments. And most parents develop an instinct for which one fits within a few days of paying attention.
