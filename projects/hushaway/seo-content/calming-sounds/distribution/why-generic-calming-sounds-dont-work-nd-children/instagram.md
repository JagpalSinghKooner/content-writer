# Instagram Content: Why Generic Calming Sounds Don't Work for ND Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
You've tried 12 apps.

Your child ignores them all.

IT'S NOT YOUR CHILD.
IT'S THE SOUNDS.

[Bold text, high contrast, calming colours]

### Slide 2: The Truth
Generic calming sounds were designed for neurotypical brains.

Your child's brain works differently.

That's not a flaw.
That's information.

### Slide 3: Adapted vs Designed
ADAPTED FOR:
Adult meditation app
→ Children's version
→ "Sensory-friendly" label

DESIGNED FOR:
Built from scratch for ND brains

The difference is everything.

### Slide 4: Why They Fail (1/3)
COGNITIVE OVERLOAD

Generic apps ask overwhelmed children to:
• Choose sound options
• Follow instructions
• Make decisions

More load = more overwhelm

### Slide 5: Why They Fail (2/3)
SENSORY MISMATCH

Generic sounds target average processing.

Your child isn't average.

Frequencies calibrated for typical ears can feel sharp, intrusive, or underwhelming to ND brains.

### Slide 6: Why They Fail (3/3)
WRONG TIMING

Pauses too long.
Changes too sudden.
Pacing built for typical brains.

ND children process continuity differently.

### Slide 7: What Actually Works
Sounds DESIGNED for ND children:

✓ No interaction required
✓ Sensory-informed design
✓ Predictable where it matters
✓ Zero cognitive demands

Built for how their brain functions.

### Slide 8: The Sign
Your child covering their ears?

That's not rejection.
That's information.

The frequencies feel wrong for their processing.

It's a sensory mismatch, not a behaviour problem.

### Slide 9: The Truth
Nothing is wrong with your child.

The sounds were designed for someone else's brain.

Your child deserves sounds designed for theirs.

### Slide 10: CTA

## Caption

You've tried the white noise. The rain sounds. Those relaxing playlists with twinkling piano music. The app that worked wonders for your friend's child.

Nothing.

Your child either ignores it completely, gets more agitated, or covers their ears and walks away. Again.

.
.
.

Here's what nobody tells you: the sounds aren't broken. Your child isn't broken. The problem is a design mismatch.

Generic calming sounds were created for brains that work one way. Your child's brain works differently. And that difference isn't a flaw—it's the key to finding what will actually help.

Most calming sounds follow a simple formula: take sounds neurotypical adults find relaxing, make them playful for children, add friendly branding. Done. But neurodivergent children don't process sound the way most people do.

The difference between "adapted for" and "designed for" changes everything.

ADAPTED starts with assumptions that may not apply to your child. An adult meditation app with a children's version still carries the original foundation: follow instructions, make choices, engage.

DESIGNED starts with a completely different foundation. Zero-demand audio. Sensory-informed frequencies. Timing calibrated for ND processing.

Three ways generic sounds fail:

1️⃣ COGNITIVE OVERLOAD: They ask overwhelmed children to choose options, follow instructions, make decisions. More demands when the system is already maxed out.

2️⃣ SENSORY MISMATCH: They're calibrated for average processing. What feels "soft" to typical ears might land as sharp or intrusive to a child with auditory hypersensitivity.

3️⃣ WRONG TIMING: Pauses, transitions, and pacing built for neurotypical processing feel "off" to ND brains.

If you've cycled through apps wondering what's wrong with your child, stop. Nothing is wrong with your child. The sounds were designed for someone else's brain.

Your child deserves sounds designed for theirs.

That's why we created The Open Sanctuary at HushAway®. Sounds built from the ground up for sensitive and neurodivergent children. No interaction required. No cognitive demands. Just press play.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your child covers their ears when you play calming sounds. Here's why."

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
"Generic calming sounds were designed for neurotypical brains. Your child's brain processes sound differently.

Three reasons they fail:

One: Cognitive overload. They ask overwhelmed children to make choices and follow instructions.

Two: Sensory mismatch. Frequencies calibrated for typical ears can feel intrusive or underwhelming to ND brains.

Three: Wrong timing. The pacing is off for how ND children process change.

Nothing is wrong with your child. The sounds were designed for someone else's brain."

**[20-30 seconds: CTA]**
"Your child deserves sounds designed for theirs. Follow for more."

## Reel Script Alternative (15 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Stop trying more calming sounds apps. Here's why they all fail."

**[3-12 seconds: VALUE]**
"They were adapted FOR neurodivergent children. None were designed FOR them.

Adapted = neurotypical content with a sensory-friendly label.
Designed = built from scratch for ND brains.

That difference is everything."

**[12-15 seconds: CTA]**
"Save this. Your child deserves better."

## Visual Notes

**Carousel Design:**
- Colours: Soft, calming palette (muted blues, gentle greens, warm neutrals)
- Fonts: Clean, sans-serif, highly readable
- Contrast: High contrast for accessibility
- Layout: Generous white space, not overwhelming
- Visual hierarchy: Bold headlines, supporting text smaller
- Avoid: Busy backgrounds, multiple fonts, sensory triggers

**Reel B-Roll Suggestions:**
- Close-up of child with headphones (covering ears vs. peaceful listening)
- Parent scrolling through dozens of apps (frustration)
- "Press play" button (simplicity)
- Child settling peacefully with sound playing
- Text overlays for three failure modes
- Calming visuals (nothing jarring or fast-moving)

**Key Visual Principle:**
The content itself should demonstrate sensory-safe design. No flashing, no overwhelming movement, no jarring transitions. Practice what we preach.
