# LinkedIn Content: Why Generic Calming Sounds Don't Work for ND Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
You've tried 12 apps.
Your child ignores them all.

It's not your child.
It's the sounds.

Swipe → to learn why

### Slide 2: The Pattern
Every app you tried was "adapted for" neurodivergent children.

None were designed for them.

That difference changes everything.

### Slide 3: Adapted vs Designed
ADAPTED:
Adult meditation app → children's version → "sensory-friendly" label

DESIGNED:
Built from scratch for how ND brains actually process sound

### Slide 4: Failure Mode 1
Cognitive Overload

Generic apps ask overwhelmed children to:
• Choose from 47 sound options
• Follow guided instructions
• Make decisions at bedtime

Zero-demand audio = press play. Done.

### Slide 5: Failure Mode 2
Sensory Mismatch

Generic sounds target average processing.

Your child isn't average.

Frequencies designed for typical ears can land as sharp, intrusive, or underwhelming.

### Slide 6: Failure Mode 3
Wrong Timing

Pauses too long. Changes too sudden.
Pacing calibrated for typical brains.

ND children process continuity and change differently.

Timing matters.

### Slide 7: What Actually Works
Sounds designed FOR neurodivergent children:

✓ No interaction required
✓ Sensory-informed design
✓ Predictable where it matters
✓ Silence used intentionally

Built for how specific brains function.

### Slide 8: The Match Matters
Same child.
Different sounds.
Different result.

The right match exists.
You just haven't found it yet.

### Slide 9: Quick Recap
Generic calming sounds fail because:

1. They require cognitive load
2. They're calibrated for typical processing
3. Their timing is off for ND brains

The solution? Sounds designed for ND children from the start.

You've tried white noise, rain sounds, meditation apps with twinkling pianos.

Nothing works.

Your ADHD or autistic child either ignores them completely, gets more agitated, or covers their ears and walks away.

Sound familiar?

Here's what nobody tells you: the sounds aren't broken. Your child isn't broken.

The problem is a design mismatch.

Generic calming sounds were created for brains that work one way. Your child's brain works differently. And that difference isn't a flaw—it's the key to finding what will actually help.

Most calming sounds on the market follow a simple formula:

1. Take sounds neurotypical adults find relaxing
2. Make them playful for children
3. Add friendly branding

Done.

But neurodivergent children don't process sound the way most people do. Research shows autistic individuals often experience atypical sensory processing, including heightened or reduced sensitivity to auditory input. For children with ADHD, sensory processing challenges frequently affect how they filter, organise, and respond to sound.

When you play generic calming sounds to a neurodivergent child, you're asking their brain to process audio that was never designed with their processing style in mind.

It's like giving someone glasses with the wrong prescription and wondering why they still can't see.

The difference between "adapted for" and "designed for" changes everything:

ADAPTED FOR starts with assumptions that may not apply. An adult meditation app with a children's version still carries the original foundation: follow instructions, make choices, engage with guided content.

DESIGNED FOR starts with a completely different foundation. Zero-demand audio. Sensory-informed frequencies. Timing calibrated for ND processing.

If you've cycled through apps wondering what's wrong with your child, stop.

Nothing is wrong with your child. The sounds were designed for someone else's brain.

Your child deserves sounds designed for theirs.

What's your experience with generic calming sounds? Have you found anything that actually works?

Three ways generic calming sounds fail neurodivergent children (and what to look for instead):

**FAILURE MODE 1: Cognitive Overload**

Most calming apps require something from the listener. Pick a category. Choose a sound. Follow along with a story.

For an overwhelmed child whose brain is already working overtime? Every additional demand makes things worse.

Your ADHD child with racing thoughts doesn't need to choose between twelve sound options. That's another decision for an already overwhelmed system.

Your autistic child in the middle of sensory overload doesn't need to follow a guided visualisation. Their brain is too busy processing the environment.

What works instead: Zero-demand audio. Press play. No choices. No interaction. No following along.

**FAILURE MODE 2: Sensory Mismatch**

Generic calming sounds are calibrated for average sensory processing. They assume a baseline response to certain frequencies, volumes, and textures.

But there's no such thing as average when it comes to neurodivergent sensory processing.

A sound that feels "soft" to most ears might land as sharp or intrusive to a child with auditory hypersensitivity. A frequency meant to be soothing might hit an uncomfortable resonance.

And the reverse is true. A "calming" sound might be so quiet or predictable that it fails to hold attention for a child whose brain needs more sensory input to feel grounded.

What works instead: Sounds created with sensory differences in mind from the start. Frequencies chosen carefully. Volume dynamics controlled. Textures considered for how they land on sensitive ears.

**FAILURE MODE 3: Timing and Pacing**

Most children's calming content has a rhythm: sounds fade in, narration pauses, music swells and softens.

This pacing assumes typical attention span and processing speed. It assumes the listener can anticipate what comes next and find comfort in that predictability.

For many neurodivergent children, this timing is off. Pauses are too long or too short. Changes come too quickly or too slowly. Unpredictable variations meant to be "interesting" create anxiety instead.

Children with ADHD might find slow, gradual changes frustrating. Autistic children might find sudden transitions jarring, even when those transitions are meant to be gentle.

What works instead: Timing built with understanding of how ND brains process change and continuity. Transitions handled differently. Silence used intentionally, not dramatically.

The match matters more than the format. More than the app reviews. More than what worked for your friend's child.

If generic calming sounds keep failing, it's not because you haven't found the right one yet. It's because the right one for your child probably doesn't exist in the "calming sounds for everyone" category.

Your child's brain processes sound differently. That's not a problem to overcome. It's information that points toward a solution.

Have you noticed any of these patterns with your child?

"My child covers their ears when I play calming sounds. What am I doing wrong?"

You're not doing anything wrong.

This is what I tell every parent who asks this question.

That response usually indicates a sensory mismatch. The sounds contain frequencies, textures, or volume dynamics that feel intrusive to your child's auditory processing.

Generic calming sounds are designed assuming typical auditory processing. They target the middle of the bell curve and hope for the best.

Your child isn't in the middle. That's not a problem. It's just information.

Research shows that autistic people may be over-sensitive (hypersensitive) or under-sensitive (hyposensitive) to sound, and this can fluctuate throughout the day. Children with ADHD frequently experience sensory processing challenges that affect how they filter and respond to auditory input.

When sounds are created specifically for neurodivergent children, the entire approach shifts:

• No interaction required (the design assumes the listener is already at capacity)
• Sensory-informed design (frequencies chosen carefully, volume dynamics controlled)
• Predictable where it matters (transitions handled differently)
• Silence as a feature (used intentionally, not dramatically)

This is the difference between sounds that hope to work for everyone and sounds built from the ground up for how specific brains actually function.

One approach crosses its fingers. The other is designed to work.

If you've been cycling through apps that weren't made for your child, the problem isn't your child. The sounds have been designed for someone else's brain.

Your child deserves sounds designed for theirs.

That's exactly why we created The Open Sanctuary at HushAway®. A library of sounds built from the ground up for sensitive and neurodivergent children. No interaction required. No cognitive demands. No decisions to make at 10pm when everyone's exhausted.

Just press play.

If you've been cycling through apps that weren't made for your child, you might find something different in The Open Sanctuary.
