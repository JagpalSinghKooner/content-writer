# Newsletter Snippet: Why Generic Calming Sounds Don't Work for ND Children

## Hook

You've tried the white noise. The rain sounds. The app that worked wonders for your friend's child. Nothing. Your child either ignores it completely or covers their ears and walks away.

## Body

Here's what nobody tells you: the sounds aren't broken. Your child isn't broken. The problem is a design mismatch.

Generic calming sounds were created for brains that work one way. Your child's brain works differently. And that difference isn't a flaw—it's actually the key to finding what will help.

Most calming sounds follow a simple formula: take sounds neurotypical adults find relaxing, make them playful for children, add friendly branding. Done. But neurodivergent children don't process sound the way most people do. Research shows autistic individuals often experience atypical sensory processing, and children with ADHD frequently face sensory processing challenges that affect how they filter and respond to sound.

The difference between "adapted for" and "designed for" changes everything. Adapted content starts with assumptions that may not apply to your child. A meditation app designed for adults still carries that foundation even when you add a children's version. Designed-for content starts with a completely different foundation: zero-demand audio, sensory-informed frequencies, timing calibrated for ND processing.

## CTA

If you've cycled through apps wondering what's wrong with your child, it's time to stop. Nothing is wrong with your child. The sounds were designed for someone else's brain.

## Alternative: Teaser Format

**This week:** Why those calming sounds apps aren't working for your child (and it's not their fault)

You've tried a dozen apps. None of them work. Here's why:

• Generic sounds require cognitive load when your child is already overwhelmed
• They're calibrated for typical sensory processing (your child isn't typical)
• Their timing and pacing is off for ND brains

The solution? Sounds designed FOR neurodivergent children from the start, not adapted from neurotypical content.

## Alternative: Parent Story Format

**A parent wrote to us last week:**

"I've tried 12 different calming sounds apps. My daughter either ignores them or gets more upset. I'm starting to think nothing will work."

Here's what we told her (and what we wish every parent knew):

The sounds aren't broken. Your daughter isn't broken. The problem is a design mismatch.

Generic calming sounds were created for brains that work one way. Your daughter's brain works differently. And that difference is the key to finding what will actually help.

Most calming sounds are "adapted for" neurodivergent children. None are "designed for" them. That distinction changes everything.

We broke down the three ways generic sounds fail ND children—and what to look for instead.
