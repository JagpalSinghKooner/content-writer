# Newsletter Snippet: Free Calming Sounds for Children UK Options

## Hook

Your child's almost settled. The rain sounds are working. You're about to tiptoe out. Then an advert blares through the speaker at full volume, and you're starting bedtime all over again.

## Body

If you've searched for free calming sounds for kids in the UK, you've probably found the same frustrating pattern: options exist, but they weren't made for children like yours.

We've tested every major free option available to UK families. CBeebies offers eight trusted sounds, but they're designed for neurotypical children. YouTube has enormous variety, but adverts interrupt the calming experience (and quality varies wildly). Free trials from apps like Moshi and Calm work well, but they expire after a week or two, often just when your child has found a sound they love.

Here's what most parents don't know: free doesn't have to mean generic anymore. The Open Sanctuary from HushAway® is the only free calming sound library in the UK designed specifically for neurodivergent and sensitive children from day one. Frequencies that actually soothe. ASMR textures without sensory triggers. Passive listening that requires no interaction. And it's free forever, not a trial.

## CTA

Your child isn't being difficult. They likely need something more specific than standard rain sounds.
