# Instagram Content: Free Calming Sounds for Children UK Options

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
FREE CALMING SOUNDS
FOR KIDS UK

(But most weren't made for
neurodivergent children)

Swipe to see all your options →

[Design: Bold text on calming blue/purple gradient background, high contrast]

### Slide 2: The Problem
You tried the YouTube video.

It worked for 3 minutes.

Then an advert blared at bedtime.

Your child went from almost-settled
to wide awake.

Sound familiar?

### Slide 3: The Pattern
Free sounds fall into 2 camps:

1. Public service (CBeebies)
   Trusted but generic

2. User-generated (YouTube)
   Variety but inconsistent

Neither built for ND children.

### Slide 4: Option 1 - CBeebies
✓ 8 calming sounds
✓ No adverts
✓ Trusted BBC quality

✗ Generic (not ND-designed)
✗ Limited variety
✗ No frequencies/ASMR

Best for neurotypical children

### Slide 5: Option 2 - YouTube
✓ Enormous variety
✓ Some ND channels

✗ Adverts interrupt
✗ Screen-based at bedtime
✗ Quality varies wildly

Needs close management

### Slide 6: Option 3 - Free Trials
✓ Professional quality
✓ Ad-free

✗ Expire after 7-14 days
✗ Adapted from neurotypical
✗ Subscription required

Works if budget allows

### Slide 7: Option 4 - The Open Sanctuary
✓ Built FOR ND children
✓ Free forever (not a trial)
✓ Passive (just press play)
✓ Frequencies + ASMR
✓ No adverts, no screen

Only free ND-designed
library in UK

### Slide 8: For Bedtime
What matters:

Screen-free
(blue light disrupts)

Consistent
(no expired trials/adverts)

Matched to need
(racing thoughts ≠ sensory sensitivity)

### Slide 9: The Truth
Free doesn't mean generic.

It just did until recently.

Your child isn't difficult.

They need sounds built for them,
not adapted for them.

### Slide 10: CTA

## Caption

Your child's almost asleep. The rain sounds are working. Then an advert blares through the speaker.

They're wide awake again.

.

If you've searched for free calming sounds for kids UK, you've probably hit the same wall: options exist, but they weren't made for children like yours.

We tested every major free option. CBeebies offers eight trusted sounds, but they're generic. YouTube has variety, but adverts interrupt at the worst moments. Free trials work well until they expire, often just when your child has found a sound they love.

Here's what changed recently: free doesn't have to mean generic anymore.

The Open Sanctuary from HushAway is the only free calming sound library in the UK designed specifically for neurodivergent and sensitive children from day one. Frequencies that soothe instead of grate. ASMR without sensory triggers. Passive listening that requires no tapping or choices. Free forever, not a trial.

Your child isn't being difficult. They likely need something more specific than standard rain sounds.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Tonight might be the night you find the sound that works.
