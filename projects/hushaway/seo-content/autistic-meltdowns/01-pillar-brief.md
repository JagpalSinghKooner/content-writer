# Pillar Brief: Autistic Meltdowns

## 1. Strategic Context

**Pillar:** Autistic meltdowns
**Priority:** Critical
**Why now:** Parents search during or immediately after meltdowns, seeking immediate solutions. Current top-ranking content is clinical and advice-heavy (National Autistic Society, NHS), with no practical "what to play NOW" guidance. HushAway can own the audio solution space for autism meltdowns—a gap every major source misses.
**Proprietary advantage:** Passive listening designed for crisis moments when both child AND parent are overwhelmed. Frequency-based sounds and ASMR specifically created for sensory regulation. No interaction required—just press play.

## 4. Content Plan

### Article 01: Understanding Autism Meltdowns: What Every Parent Needs to Know (PRIORITY: Do First)

- **Target keyword:** autism meltdown child
- **Secondary keywords:** meltdown vs tantrum autism, what is autism meltdown, autistic meltdown
- **Content type:** Educational explainer (foundation article)
- **Word count:** 2,000-2,500
- **Angle opportunity:** Validate parent experience first, then explain WHY meltdowns happen in parent language (not clinical). Introduce sound as one tool in the toolkit.

### Article 02: What to Play During an Autism Meltdown: Sound Solutions That Actually Help

- **Target keyword:** calming autistic child meltdown
- **Secondary keywords:** sounds for autism meltdown, what helps autism meltdown, autism calming music meltdown
- **Content type:** How-To with specific recommendations
- **Word count:** 2,000-2,500
- **Angle opportunity:** "What to play NOW" — the actionable guide nobody else provides. Cover: what sounds work (frequencies, ASMR, brown noise), what to avoid (lyrics, unpredictable changes), how to introduce sound during crisis.

### Article 03: After School Meltdowns: Why They Happen and How Sound Helps

- **Target keyword:** after school meltdown autism
- **Secondary keywords:** autism meltdown after school, school sensory overload autism
- **Content type:** Situation-specific How-To
- **Word count:** 1,800-2,200
- **Angle opportunity:** "Masking all day, then exploding at home" — validates the pattern parents know but don't understand. Position sound as the sensory reset tool.

### Article 04: Meltdown Recovery: What Actually Helps Your Child Afterwards

- **Target keyword:** after meltdown autism
- **Secondary keywords:** meltdown recovery autism, calm after autism meltdown
- **Content type:** How-To
- **Word count:** 1,800-2,200
- **Angle opportunity:** MAJOR GAP in competitor content. Recovery extends hours/days after meltdown. Sound supports regulation without adding demands. Address shame, memory gaps, secondary stress.

### Article 05: Meltdown vs Shutdown: Understanding the Difference

- **Target keyword:** autism shutdown vs meltdown
- **Secondary keywords:** autistic shutdown child, shutdown autism help
- **Content type:** Comparison
- **Word count:** 1,500-2,000

- **Target keyword:** preventing autism meltdowns
- **Secondary keywords:** autism meltdown triggers, warning signs autism meltdown
- **Content type:** How-To
- **Word count:** 2,000-2,500
- **Angle opportunity:** Triggers are cumulative ("the tiny thing that breaks them wasn't tiny"). Sound as preventive tool—build regulation throughout the day, not just in crisis.

### Article 07: The Complete Guide to Autism Meltdowns (PUBLISH LAST)

- **Target keyword:** autism meltdown uk
- **Secondary keywords:** autism meltdown guide, autism meltdown help, what helps autism meltdown
- **Content type:** Comprehensive pillar guide
- **Word count:** 4,000-5,000

## 5. Angle Opportunities

Based on competitor gaps, these angles are available:

1. **"What to Play NOW"** — Every competitor says "try calming music" but NEVER tells parents what to actually play. HushAway fills this gap with specific recommendations.

2. **"The Missing Tool"** — Sound is mentioned once in passing by major sources but never developed. Position sound as the sensory regulation tool that works when others can't (weighted blankets require touch, fidgets require motor control, sound is passive).

3. **"Zero-Effort for Crisis"** — When your child is melting down, YOU'RE overwhelmed too. Passive listening requires nothing from parent or child—just press play.

4. **"The Three Phases"** — Prevention, During, Recovery. Competitors focus on "during" with some prevention. Recovery is barely covered. HushAway addresses all three with sound solutions for each.

5. **"UK Parent Voice"** — Not clinical NHS language, not US-based (CHADD, ADDitude). Parent-to-parent voice for UK families who feel unseen by American content.

**Recommended primary angle:** "What to Play NOW" — This directly addresses the action parents are searching for and is the single biggest gap in competitor content. Every other angle reinforces this.
