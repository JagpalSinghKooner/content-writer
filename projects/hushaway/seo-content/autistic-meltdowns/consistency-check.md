## Positioning Alignment

| Article | Assigned Angle | Rating | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| 01-understanding-autism-meltdowns | Neurological foundation explanation | Strong | Establishes "what's actually happening" clearly. Positions sound as working because it's passive. |
| 02-sounds-to-play-autism-meltdown | Direct answer to "what to play" | Strong | THE gap-filler article. Delivers specific sound types, what to avoid, how to introduce. |
| 03-after-school-autism-meltdown-why | Masking debt and after-school pattern | Strong | Names the pattern ("masking debt"), positions home as safe space, sound as reset tool. |
| 04-autism-meltdown-recovery-guide | Recovery focus (gap competitors miss) | Strong | Entirely focused on the overlooked aftermath. Sound positioned as ongoing support. |
| 05-autism-meltdown-vs-shutdown-difference | Meltdown vs shutdown differentiation | Strong | Clear distinction between outward/inward overwhelm. Shutdown positioned as "quiet crisis." |
| 06-preventing-autism-meltdowns-warning-signs | Cumulative triggers, prevention as daily regulation | Strong | "Wrong socks weren't the problem" angle delivered. Sound positioned as daily prevention tool. |
| 07-complete-guide-autism-meltdowns-uk-parents | Comprehensive pillar guide | Strong | Synthesises all angles. UK-specific context. Fills "what to actually play" gap for UK parents. |

### Weak Alignments (must fix)

None. All articles strongly aligned with assigned angles.

### Moderate Alignments (should fix)

None. No articles showing moderate alignment issues.

## Brand Voice Notes (informational)

| Article | Brand Vocabulary Usage | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| 01-understanding-autism-meltdowns | Strong | Warm parent-to-parent voice. "You've been there" opening. Avoids clinical jargon. |
| 02-sounds-to-play-autism-meltdown | Strong | "You're in the thick of it right now" - empathetic, immediate. Natural UK English throughout. |
| 03-after-school-autism-meltdown-why | Strong | "3:47pm. The school door opens." - specific, relatable. Validates parent experience. |
| 04-autism-meltdown-recovery-guide | Strong | "The screaming has stopped. But they're not okay." - real parent experience captured. |
| 05-autism-meltdown-vs-shutdown-difference | Strong | "The quiet crisis your child might be hiding" - positions overlooked experience. |
| 06-preventing-autism-meltdowns-warning-signs | Strong | "It wasn't the socks" - immediately relatable, contrarian to standard trigger advice. |
| 07-complete-guide-autism-meltdowns-uk-parents | Strong | UK-specific language ("NHS guidance", "National Autistic Society"). Parent frustration acknowledged. |

All articles maintain warm, parent-to-parent voice per profile requirements. No clinical jargon. Natural contractions used throughout. Brand voice consistent across pillar.

## Resolution Required

### CRITICAL: Internal Link Format

All 42 internal link violations must be fixed before publication. This is a technical requirement for CMS compatibility.

**Fix pattern:**
- Find: `/autistic-meltdowns/{anything}/{filename}` or `/autistic-meltdowns/{filename}`
- Replace with: `/{slug-from-target-article-frontmatter}`

**Example:**
- `/autistic-meltdowns/01-understanding-autism-meltdowns` → `/understanding-autism-meltdowns`
- `/autistic-meltdowns/articles/02-what-to-play-during-meltdown` → `/sounds-to-play-autism-meltdown`

This fix should be applied systematically across all 7 articles in both frontmatter and content body.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Content Quality:** Excellent. All articles demonstrate strong positioning alignment, consistent terminology, no conflicting claims, and consistent brand voice.

**Technical Compliance:** Failed due to internal link format violations across all articles.

**Recommendation:** Fix all 42 internal link format issues, then re-validate. Content is publication-ready once links are corrected.
