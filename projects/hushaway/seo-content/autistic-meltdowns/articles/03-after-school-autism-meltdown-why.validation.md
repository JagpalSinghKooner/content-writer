### Brand Voice

- **Aligned:** Yes
- **Tone Match:** Warm, parent-to-parent. Natural contractions used throughout ("it's", "you're", "they're", "don't"). Conversational without being clinical.
- **Terminology:** Correct - uses "overwhelm" not "dysregulation", "self-soothing" not "stimming", warm everyday language throughout
- **Notes:** Strong alignment with HushAway® brand voice. Opening scene-setting (3:47pm) is engaging. "Masking debt" terminology works well. Good balance of empathy and practical guidance.

---

### Pillar Consistency

- [x] Article aligns with assigned angle ["After school meltdowns: masking debt + sound as reset"]
- [ ] Internal links reference pillar articles correctly [FAIL: all links use directory paths instead of `/{slug}` format]
- [x] Messaging consistent with positioning.md ["Passive listening" mechanism reinforced, positions sound as "discharge" tool]

**Critical Issue:** All 7 internal links use directory structure format (`/autistic-meltdowns/article-name`) instead of the required `/{slug}` format. Per universal-rules.md section 5a, links will break in production CMS where URLs are slug-based, not file-path-based.
