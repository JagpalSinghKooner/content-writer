### Summary

**Total FAIL issues:** 7
**Total WARN issues:** 0

**Primary issue:** All internal links use directory structure format (`/autistic-meltdowns/article-slug`) instead of slug-only format (`/article-slug`). This violates Rule 5a of universal-rules.md.

**Fix required:** Update all internal link URLs in both content body and frontmatter to use slug-only format.

**Otherwise:** Content quality is excellent. Brand voice aligned. SEO requirements met. Readability strong. No AI fingerprints. Pillar angle executed well.
