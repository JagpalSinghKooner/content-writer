### FAIL Issues (must fix before publishing)

1. **Line 45:** Internal link format incorrect `/autistic-meltdowns/01-understanding-autism-meltdowns` → use `/understanding-autism-meltdowns` (slug only, no directory)
2. **Line 47:** Internal link format incorrect `/autistic-meltdowns/04-meltdown-recovery` → use `/helping-child-recover-after-meltdown` (slug only, no directory)
3. **Line 49:** Internal link format incorrect `/autistic-meltdowns/06-preventing-meltdowns` → use `/preventing-autism-meltdowns-warning-signs` (slug only, no directory)
4. **Line 54:** Internal link format incorrect `/autistic-meltdowns/07-complete-guide-autism-meltdowns-uk-parents` → use `/complete-guide-autism-meltdowns-uk-parents` (slug only, no directory)
5. **Line 247:** Internal link format incorrect `/autistic-meltdowns/autism-meltdown-recovery-guide` → use `/helping-child-recover-after-meltdown` (slug only, no directory)
6. **Line 263:** Internal link format incorrect `/autistic-meltdowns/preventing-autism-meltdowns-warning-signs` → use `/preventing-autism-meltdowns-warning-signs` (slug only, no directory)
7. **Slug:** "sounds-to-play-autism-meltdown" appears to be keyword-focused but acceptable as it includes context ("sounds-to-play") - however, consider more descriptive format like "guide-sounds-to-play-autism-meltdown" for clarity
8. **H1:** Contains keyword but hook could be stronger - "A Parent's Guide to Sounds That Actually Help" is good but could emphasize the specificity gap more clearly per positioning angle

### WARN Issues (should fix for quality)

1. **Contractions:** Generally good use of contractions throughout, maintaining conversational tone
2. **Sentence variety:** Good mix of short and long sentences - no monotony detected
3. **Personal voice:** Strong parent-to-parent voice throughout - aligned with brand
4. **Examples:** Good specific examples (brown noise, pink noise, ASMR) with research backing
5. **Active voice:** Predominantly active voice - well done

### Summary

**Primary Issue:** Internal link format violates universal-rules.md Section 5a. All 6 internal links use directory structure (`/autistic-meltdowns/[slug]`) instead of slug-only format (`/[slug]`).

**Why this fails:** Articles will be uploaded to a CMS where URLs are defined by slug, not file structure. Links using directory paths will break in production.

**Fix required:** Update all internal links to use `/{slug}` format:
- `/autistic-meltdowns/01-understanding-autism-meltdowns` → `/understanding-autism-meltdowns`
- `/autistic-meltdowns/04-meltdown-recovery` → `/helping-child-recover-after-meltdown`
- `/autistic-meltdowns/06-preventing-meltdowns` → `/preventing-autism-meltdowns-warning-signs`
- `/autistic-meltdowns/07-complete-guide-autism-meltdowns-uk-parents` → `/complete-guide-autism-meltdowns-uk-parents`
- `/autistic-meltdowns/autism-meltdown-recovery-guide` → `/helping-child-recover-after-meltdown`
- `/autistic-meltdowns/preventing-autism-meltdowns-warning-signs` → `/preventing-autism-meltdowns-warning-signs`

**Secondary Issue (WARN):** Slug could be more descriptive. "sounds-to-play-autism-meltdown" is acceptable but "guide-sounds-to-play-autism-meltdown" would be clearer.

**Overall Quality:** Content is excellent. Brand voice alignment is strong. SEO requirements met. Readability excellent. Only the internal link format needs correction.
