### Notes

**Single FAIL Issue:**

Line 159 contains an internal link with directory structure:
`/autistic-meltdowns/sounds-to-play-autism-meltdown`

Per universal-rules.md section 5a, internal links must use slug-only format:
`/{slug}`

The correct format should be:
`/what-to-play-during-meltdown`

(This assumes the target article's slug is "what-to-play-during-meltdown". If the target article doesn't exist yet, use placeholder format: `<!-- LINK NEEDED: what-to-play-during-meltdown when published -->`.)

**Overall Quality:**

This is strong content with excellent brand voice alignment and natural writing. The single FAIL is a technical formatting issue that's easily corrected. Once the internal link format is fixed, this article will PASS validation.
