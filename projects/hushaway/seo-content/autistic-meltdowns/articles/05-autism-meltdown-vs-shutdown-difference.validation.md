### Brand Voice

- **Aligned:** Yes
- **Tone Match:** Warm parent-to-parent voice maintained throughout. Conversational, empathetic, reassuring. No clinical jargon.
- **Terminology:** Correct use of HushAway® terminology. Uses "overwhelm" instead of "dysregulation," "passive listening" correctly positioned.
- **Notes:** Article successfully delivers serious topic with warmth, not heaviness. Opening hook is strong and relatable. No clinical tone detected.

---

### Pillar Consistency

- [x] Article aligns with assigned angle "Shutdowns are quiet and easy to miss"
- [x] Messaging consistent with positioning.md (shutdown as "quiet crisis")
- [x] Sound positioned as passive tool for both meltdowns and shutdowns (nuanced approach)
- [x] No contradictions with other pillar content

**Note:** Angle implementation is excellent. Article successfully differentiates meltdown (outward) vs shutdown (inward) while maintaining consistent message that sound-based support works for both.
