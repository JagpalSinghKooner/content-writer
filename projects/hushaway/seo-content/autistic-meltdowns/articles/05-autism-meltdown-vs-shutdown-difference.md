Your child comes home from school. Walks past you without a word. Goes straight to their room. Closes the door.

You call after them. Nothing.

You knock. "How was your day?" Still nothing.

You peek in. They're sitting on the bed, staring at the wall. Or curled under the covers at 4pm. Eyes open but not really seeing anything.

Tired, you think. Or maybe sulking. Needs space. Had a rough day.

Here's what you might be missing: this isn't rest. This is a shutdown. And it's the crisis that nobody talks about.

When we talk about autism meltdowns, most people picture the dramatic version. The screaming. The kicking. The visible distress that makes strangers stare.

But there's another response to overwhelm that looks completely different.

It's quiet. It's still. And because it doesn't demand attention the way a meltdown does, it often goes completely unrecognised. Days of shutdowns can pass before anyone realises something is wrong.

If you're wondering about the difference between an autism shutdown vs meltdown, you're not alone. Many parents have never heard the word "shutdown" until they stumble across it while researching something else entirely.

Then suddenly, things click into place. That quiet child who "checks out" after school? That's not rudeness. That's not laziness. That's a nervous system that's gone offline.

## What Is an Autism Shutdown?

Think of it as two different alarm systems.

A meltdown is the brain hitting the alarm switch. Sirens blaring. Everyone can hear it.

A shutdown is the brain hitting the off switch. Complete power cut. Nobody notices until they look closely.

According to Ambitious about Autism, 2024: [Meltdowns and shutdowns](https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/understanding-autism/behaviour/meltdowns-and-shutdowns), shutdowns happen when someone becomes so overwhelmed that their brain and body disconnect. The person may become non-verbal, physically still, or seem "spaced out." They're not ignoring you. They're not being rude. Their brain has simply gone offline to protect itself from further input.

And here's where the confusion happens. A child mid-meltdown is impossible to miss. A child mid-shutdown? They might look fine. Quiet. Compliant, even.

But inside? They're drowning. In silence.

## Understanding the Difference Between Meltdowns and Shutdowns

Both meltdowns and shutdowns come from the same place: nervous system overload.

Too much sensory input. Too much emotional demand. Too much change. Too many expectations. The bucket has overflowed (we explain [what happens during an autism meltdown](/understanding-autism-meltdowns) in detail).

The difference? It's all in how the overwhelm comes out.

**A meltdown is outward.** Energy explodes. You see crying, screaming, hitting, throwing, running. The child can't contain what's happening inside, so it bursts out. Loud. Visible. Impossible to ignore.

**A shutdown is inward.** Energy collapses. You see withdrawal, silence, stillness, blank stares. The child can't process what's happening, so they disappear inside themselves. Quiet. Invisible. Easy to miss entirely.

A simple way to remember: meltdown is fight-or-flight. Shutdown is freeze.

Both are involuntary. Neither is a choice. Your child isn't having a meltdown to manipulate you. They're not having a shutdown to punish you with silence. Their nervous system is doing what nervous systems do when they hit capacity.

## Why Shutdowns Get Missed

Meltdowns demand attention. Shutdowns don't.

When your child screams in the supermarket, you respond. You have to. But when your child goes quiet and still? Easy to think: "Oh good, they've calmed down." Or: "They must be tired." Or: "They just need some alone time."

Sometimes they do need alone time. Sometimes they are just tired.

This is what makes shutdowns so tricky to spot.

But other times, that quiet child sitting in their room isn't resting. They're overwhelmed beyond words. They've run out of capacity to communicate, to move, to engage with the world.

And because they're not making noise, nobody notices. Not teachers. Not siblings. Sometimes not even parents who are paying attention.

This is why the National Autistic Society, 2024: [Meltdowns - a guide for all audiences](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/behaviour/meltdowns/all-audiences) emphasises that shutdowns need just as much understanding and support as meltdowns. The external presentation is different. The internal experience can be just as intense.

Some children experience only meltdowns. Some experience only shutdowns. Many experience both, depending on the situation, the type of overwhelm, and how much energy they have left.

Here's where it gets complicated: a child who has meltdowns at home might have shutdowns at school. Why? Because the social pressure to "hold it together" makes the explosive response feel impossible. So instead of exploding outward, they implode inward. Same overwhelm. Different outlet.

## Signs Your Child Is Having a Shutdown

Because shutdowns are quiet, you have to look more closely. Here's what to watch for.

**Physical signs:**
- Becoming very still or moving in slow motion
- Slumped posture, low muscle tone (like the strings have been cut)
- Blank or glazed expression (lights on, nobody home)
- Not making eye contact, or making very little
- Curling up, hiding under blankets, seeking enclosed spaces

**Communication signs:**
- Reduced speech or becoming completely non-verbal
- Single-word answers. Or no answers at all.
- Delayed responses, as if they didn't hear you (they heard you, they just can't process)
- Echolalia (repeating phrases) or falling back on scripted speech

**Behavioural signs:**
- Withdrawing from people and activities they normally enjoy
- Stopping mid-task and not resuming
- Appearing "checked out" or dissociated
- Not responding to their name
- Seeming emotionally flat, like someone dimmed their personality

Here's the tricky part: some of these signs overlap with ordinary tiredness, introversion, or simply needing space. Context matters.

Did something overwhelming happen before this? Has the day been full of demands? Is this their usual "I need alone time" or does something feel different?

You know your child better than anyone. Trust what you're seeing.

## Helping a Child Through a Shutdown

Your instinct when your child goes quiet is to ask questions. "What's wrong? Did something happen? Are you okay? Talk to me."

During a shutdown, this backfires completely.

Questions are demands. They require processing. And your child can't process right now. Every "are you okay?" adds more weight to an already overloaded system.

Here's what actually helps:

**Reduce demands to zero.** No questions. No requests. No expectations. Let them exist without having to respond or perform. This is harder than it sounds, especially when you're worried.

**Create safety.** Dim lights if possible. Reduce noise. Let them stay in their safe space, whether that's their room, under a blanket, or wherever they've gone. Don't force them to come out or engage.

**Be present but not intrusive.** Sometimes just being nearby helps. Sitting in the same room without speaking. Being available without demanding attention. A quiet "I'm here when you're ready" and nothing more.

**Wait.** Just like meltdowns, shutdowns run their course. The nervous system needs time to reset. This isn't something you can talk them out of or speed up. Your job is to protect the space for recovery.

**Offer sound, not words.** This is where passive audio becomes powerful. Gentle soundscapes or low frequencies give the nervous system something safe to land on without adding any demands. No interaction required. No choices to make. Just background calm that signals "you're safe."

For ideas on [what sounds help during meltdowns](/sounds-to-play-autism-meltdown), see our guide. Many of these same approaches work for shutdowns, though you might choose even quieter, simpler sounds. During shutdown, the goal is to reduce input, not introduce new stimulation.

## How Sound Helps Differently for Shutdowns

During a meltdown, sound provides a grounding point. Something for the brain to grab onto amid the chaos. An anchor when everything is spiralling outward.

During a shutdown, sound works differently.

The nervous system has gone into protective mode. It's not spiralling. It's frozen. Gentle sound can help signal safety, letting the brain know it's okay to slowly come back online.

Think of it this way: meltdown sounds are an anchor. Shutdown sounds are a gentle invitation.

For shutdowns, you want:
- Very quiet volume, barely there
- Simple, predictable patterns with no sudden changes
- No lyrics, no voices (these add processing demand)
- Ambient textures or low frequencies
- The option to turn it off easily if it's not helping

Some children find sound helpful during shutdown. Others find any additional input overwhelming and need complete silence. Watch how your child responds. If they tense up or seem more withdrawn when you add sound, turn it off. If they seem to settle or soften, it's working.

The beauty of passive audio is that it asks nothing of your child. No interaction. No response required. It's there if it helps. It can disappear if it doesn't.

## What Comes After a Shutdown

The shutdown ends. But your child doesn't immediately bounce back to normal.

Just like with meltdown recovery (we've written more about [helping your child recover here](/helping-child-recover-after-meltdown)), there's a period after a shutdown where they're fragile. Sometimes more fragile than after a meltdown, because shutdowns can last longer and drain more deeply.

They might be:
- Exhausted, physically and mentally, sometimes for hours
- Disoriented, not sure how much time passed
- Emotionally sensitive, easily upset by small things
- Needing extra reassurance that everything is okay
- Hungry or thirsty (body signals were suppressed during the shutdown)

Give them time. Keep demands low for longer than you think necessary. Offer water, a snack, quiet activities. Let them ease back into the world rather than jumping straight into homework or family dinner.

And resist the urge to ask too many questions about what happened. If they want to talk about it, they will. If they don't, pressing them just adds to the overwhelm. Sometimes the kindest thing you can say is nothing at all.

## Preventing Shutdowns (Where Possible)

You can't prevent all shutdowns. Just like you can't prevent all meltdowns.

But you can reduce how often they happen by keeping the "bucket" from filling too fast.

Watch for early warning signs. If your child is getting quieter than usual, taking longer to respond, or seeking more sensory breaks, they might be heading toward overload. Intervening early can sometimes prevent the full shutdown. That might mean leaving an overwhelming environment, offering a quiet break, or playing some gentle sounds to help the nervous system settle before it hits capacity.

Building regulation into the day helps too. Rather than waiting for crisis, using calming sounds and sensory breaks throughout the day keeps the bucket from overflowing in the first place. Think of it as maintenance rather than emergency response.

We'll cover this more in our article on [preventing meltdowns before they start](/preventing-autism-meltdowns-warning-signs).

## The Quiet Crisis

Meltdowns get the attention. Shutdowns get overlooked.

But that child who goes silent after school? The one who seems "fine" because they're not causing trouble? They might need just as much support as the child having a visible meltdown.

Maybe more. Because nobody's noticing.

If you recognise your child in this article, if you've been wondering why they seem to "check out" sometimes, or why they go non-verbal after busy days, now you have a name for it.

Shutdown.

And more importantly, you have tools to help. Not lectures. Not consequences. Not questions demanding to know what's wrong.

Just space. Safety. Time. And maybe some gentle sound to signal that the world is okay.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Sometimes that quiet moment is giving them permission to be quiet themselves.

If you're looking for sounds designed specifically for these moments, The Open Sanctuary has a collection of passive listening experiences created for sensitive and neurodivergent children. No interaction required. No decisions to make. No demands on an already overwhelmed system.

Just press play.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between an autism meltdown and a shutdown?

A meltdown is an outward explosion of overwhelm. Your child might scream, cry, hit, or run. A shutdown is an inward collapse. Your child might go quiet, still, or non-verbal. Both come from the same place: nervous system overload. But they look completely different. Meltdowns are loud and visible. Shutdowns are quiet and easy to miss.

### Why does my child go non-verbal during a shutdown?

During shutdown, your child's brain has become so overwhelmed that it can't process the demands of speech. Speaking requires significant cognitive effort, even when it looks effortless. When the system is overloaded, that capacity simply isn't available. Going non-verbal isn't a choice. It's the brain protecting itself by reducing demands.

### Should I leave my child alone during a shutdown?

It depends on your child. Some children need complete solitude to recover. Others feel safer knowing you're nearby, even if they can't interact with you. Try being present but not intrusive. Sit in the same room without making demands. If your child seems to want more space, give it. If they seem to relax with you nearby, stay. You know your child best.

### How long do autism shutdowns last?

Shutdowns vary widely. Some last minutes. Others last hours. Unlike meltdowns, which often have a visible peak and wind-down, shutdowns can be harder to time. Your child might come out of it gradually, slowly becoming more responsive, or they might stay in a low-energy state for the rest of the day. Recovery time afterwards can also be significant, so don't expect normal functioning immediately after.

### Can my child have both meltdowns and shutdowns?

Yes. Many autistic children experience both, depending on the situation, the type of overload, and how much energy they have. A child might meltdown at home (where they feel safe to express) but shutdown at school (where social pressure makes the outward response feel impossible). Some children switch between the two, or experience shutdown followed by meltdown when they feel safer.
