# Newsletter Snippet: What's Actually Happening During Your Child's Meltdown

## Hook

You've been there. Your child is on the floor, screaming. Maybe kicking. Maybe completely frozen. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you're wondering what you did wrong.

## Body

Here's what nobody told you about an autism meltdown in your child: it's not bad behaviour. It's not a tantrum. It's not a parenting failure. And it's definitely not something stricter discipline will fix.

A meltdown is what happens when your child's brain gets more input than it can process. Think of it like a computer asked to run too many programs at once. It doesn't slow down gracefully. It crashes.

The difference between a meltdown and a tantrum? A tantrum is goal-directed—your child wants something and is using behaviour to try to get it. A meltdown has no goal. Your child has lost the ability to regulate their response to overwhelm. The meltdown runs its course because that's what neurological overwhelm does.

Understanding this changes everything. Not because it makes meltdowns stop (wouldn't that be nice), but because it helps you respond in a way that actually helps. It stops the self-blame. It stops the guilt spiral at 2am. And it means you can finally explain to that judgemental relative why "being stricter" isn't the answer.

• Most calming tools fail mid-meltdown?

This article breaks down what's actually happening in your child's brain, the sensory bucket theory, and why sound works differently than other calming tools.
