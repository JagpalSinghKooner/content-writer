## Carousel: What's Actually Happening During Your Child's Meltdown

### Slide 1: Hook
Your child is on the floor, screaming.

And somewhere in your mind, you're wondering what you did wrong.

Here's what nobody told you →

### Slide 2: The Truth
A meltdown isn't bad behaviour.

It's not a tantrum.

It's not a parenting failure.

It's what happens when your child's brain gets more input than it can process.

### Slide 3: The Computer Analogy
Think of it like a computer asked to run too many programs at once.

It doesn't slow down gracefully.

It crashes.

That's what's happening in your child's brain during a meltdown.

### Slide 4: Meltdown vs Tantrum
A TANTRUM is goal-directed.
Your child wants something and is using behaviour to get it.

A MELTDOWN has no goal.
Your child has lost the ability to regulate due to neurological overwhelm.

### Slide 5: The Sensory Bucket
Imagine an invisible bucket that fills all day:

• Scratchy school uniform: a few drops
• Noisy cafeteria: half a cup
• Unexpected fire drill: a splash
• Brushing past someone: another drop

When the bucket overflows → meltdown.

### Slide 6: Why After-School Meltdowns Happen
Your child held it together ALL DAY.

Their bucket filled and filled.

Then they get home (their safe space) and it all comes out.

It's not that home is the problem.
It's that home is where they feel safe enough to release.

### Slide 7: Why Sound Works Differently
Most calming tools require something from your overwhelmed child:

✗ Weighted blankets → touch tolerance
✗ Fidget toys → motor control
✗ Breathing exercises → cognitive processing

Sound is different.
It reaches the nervous system without requiring anything.

Just press play.

### Slide 8: What Helps
During a meltdown:

• Reduce sensory input (dim lights, lower voice)
• Stop talking (they can't process language)
• Ensure safety (move dangerous objects)
• Wait (meltdowns run their course)

Your job is to keep them safe, not make it stop faster.

### Slide 9: The Real Job
Your job isn't to prevent all meltdowns (you can't).

It's to:
→ Understand what's happening
→ Respond helpfully, not harmfully
→ Stop the self-blame spiral
→ Build your child's capacity over time

### Slide 10: CTA
A meltdown is neurological overflow, not misbehaviour.

Understanding this changes everything.

## Text Post 1: The Supermarket Moment

You've been there.

Your child is on the floor of the supermarket. Screaming. Maybe kicking. And that stranger is staring at you like you're the world's worst parent.

Here's what nobody tells you about autism meltdowns:

It's not bad behaviour. It's not a tantrum. It's not a parenting failure.

A meltdown is what happens when your child's brain gets more input than it can process. Think of it like a computer asked to run too many programs at once. It doesn't slow down gracefully. It crashes.

Research shows up to 90% of autistic individuals process sensory information differently. The sounds you barely notice might be painfully loud for your child. The seams in their socks might feel like sandpaper all day. Fluorescent lights might flicker in a way only they perceive.

At some point, something gives.

Understanding the difference between a meltdown and a tantrum changes everything:

A tantrum is goal-directed. Your child wants something. They're using behaviour to try to get it. Tantrums stop when the child gets what they want, or realises the behaviour isn't working.

A meltdown has no goal. Your child isn't trying to achieve anything. They've lost the ability to regulate their response to overwhelm. The meltdown runs its course because that's what neurological overwhelm does.

During a meltdown, trying to reason with your child is like trying to have a conversation with someone who's drowning. They can't hear you. Their brain is in survival mode. The thinking part of their brain has temporarily gone offline.

Your job isn't to make it stop faster. Your job is to keep them safe until their nervous system can reset.

And to the stranger staring in the supermarket? Their judgement says nothing about your parenting.

## Text Post 2: The After-School Explosion

"But they've been fine all day at school. Then they get home and fall apart."

Sound familiar?

Here's why after-school meltdowns are so common, and why they're actually a sign of something positive.

Think of your child as having an invisible bucket that fills throughout the day. Every sensory input, every social demand, every unexpected change adds water to that bucket.

The scratchy school uniform: a few drops.
The noisy cafeteria at lunch: half a cup.
Having to switch activities unexpectedly: more water.
The fire drill nobody warned them about: a splash.
The child who brushed past them in the corridor: another drop.

None of these things, on their own, seems like a big deal. But they're all adding to the bucket. Drop by drop, all day long.

Your child has been holding it together ALL DAY. Their bucket filling and filling. Managing sensory overload. Following social rules they don't instinctively understand. Keeping their body still when everything in them wants to move.

Then they get home.

Home is their safe space. The place where they can finally release everything they've been holding in. So the bucket overflows.

It's not that home is the problem. It's that home is where they finally feel safe enough to let go.

That after-school meltdown? It's not a sign you're doing something wrong. It's a sign your child trusts you enough to fall apart in front of you.

And here's the frustrating part: the thing that appears to "cause" the meltdown (you asked them to brush their teeth, you took a different route home) is rarely the real cause. It's just the drop that made the bucket overflow.

This is why meltdowns can seem so random. So unpredictable.

But when you understand the bucket, it starts to make sense.

How do you support your child after school?

## Text Post 3: Why Sound Works When Nothing Else Does

When your child is mid-meltdown, most calming techniques fail.

And there's a simple reason: they all require something from your already overwhelmed child.

Think about it:

Weighted blankets require tolerance for touch (often rejected during meltdowns)

Fidget toys require motor control (often impossible when overwhelmed)

Breathing exercises require cognitive processing (unavailable when the thinking brain is offline)

Apps and games require interaction and decision-making (adds demands, not removes them)

Every one of these tools asks something of a child who has nothing left to give.

This is where sound becomes different.

Sound can reach the nervous system without requiring anything from your child. They don't have to do anything. They don't have to engage. They don't have to calm down. They just have to be within hearing distance.

Certain frequencies and soundscapes can give an overwhelmed nervous system something to land on. Something predictable. Something safe. Without adding any demands.

Sound works differently than other calming tools because it's passive. Press play. That's it. No decisions. No demands. No effort required from you or your child in that moment when you're both already stretched thin.

It doesn't work for every child, every time. Nothing does. But for many sensitive and neurodivergent children, sound creates a pathway to regulation that doesn't ask them to do the impossible.

HushAway® was built around this principle. Passive listening experiences designed for overwhelmed nervous systems. Frequencies, ASMR sounds, and gentle stories that require nothing but presence.

If you're looking for tools that work during the hardest moments, The Open Sanctuary offers a free sound library to explore.
