# Twitter/X Content: Autism Meltdowns

## Thread: What's Actually Happening During Your Child's Meltdown

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your child is on the floor screaming and that stranger is judging you.

Here's what nobody told you about autism meltdowns:

It's not bad behaviour. It's neurological overflow.

🧵 A thread for exhausted parents:

### Tweet 2
First, what it's NOT:

• Not a tantrum
• Not manipulation
• Not "attention seeking"
• Not something stricter discipline will fix

A meltdown is a neurological event. Your child's nervous system has hit a limit.

### Tweet 3
The difference between a meltdown and a tantrum:

TANTRUM: Goal-directed. Your child wants something. Using behaviour to get it.

MELTDOWN: No goal. Lost ability to regulate due to overwhelm.

During a meltdown, your child couldn't care less what you're doing.

### Tweet 4
What's happening in their brain:

The thinking part (prefrontal cortex) goes offline. The survival brain takes over.

This is why your calm, logical explanations don't work mid-meltdown. The part that could process language is temporarily unavailable.

### Tweet 5
The Sensory Bucket Theory:

Imagine your child has an invisible bucket that fills all day.

Every sensory input, every social demand, every unexpected change adds water.

When the bucket overflows → meltdown.

### Tweet 6
Why after-school meltdowns happen:

Your child held it together ALL DAY. Their bucket filling and filling.

Then they get home (their safe space) and it all comes out.

It's not that home is the problem. Home is where they feel safe enough to release.

### Tweet 7
The thing that appears to "cause" the meltdown (you asked them to brush teeth, took a different route home) is rarely the real cause.

It's just the drop that made the bucket overflow.

This is why meltdowns seem so random. So unpredictable.

### Tweet 8
Why most calming tools fail mid-meltdown:

• Weighted blankets → require touch tolerance
• Fidget toys → require motor control
• Breathing exercises → require cognitive processing
• Apps/games → require interaction

All of these ask something from an already overwhelmed child.

### Tweet 9
Sound is different.

It reaches the nervous system without requiring anything from your child.

Just press play. No decisions. No demands. No effort.

Certain frequencies give an overwhelmed nervous system something safe to land on.

### Tweet 10
What to do during a meltdown:

• Reduce sensory input (dim lights, lower voice)
• Stop talking (they can't process language)
• Ensure safety (move dangerous objects)
• Wait (meltdowns run their course)

Your job: keep them safe, not make it stop faster.

### Tweet 11
After the meltdown:

Your child might be exhausted, confused, clingy, or need space.

They might not remember what happened.

This is where your response matters: Quiet. Calm. Low-demand time. No lectures. No immediate "lessons."

### Tweet 12
TL;DR:

• Meltdown ≠ tantrum (neurological vs behavioural)
• Think: sensory bucket filling all day
• Most tools fail because they add demands
• Your job: safety, not speed
• After: low-demand recovery time

A meltdown is overflow, not misbehaviour.

### Tweet 13 (CTA)
Understanding what's actually happening changes everything.

It stops the self-blame. It stops the guilt spiral at 2am.

And it means you can finally explain to that judgemental relative why "being stricter" isn't the answer.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (The Core Insight)
A meltdown isn't your child being difficult.

It's what happens when their brain gets more input than it can process.

Think: computer asked to run too many programs. It doesn't slow down gracefully. It crashes.

That's a meltdown.

### Tweet B (The Bucket)
Your child has an invisible bucket that fills all day:

• Scratchy uniform: drops
• Noisy cafeteria: half a cup
• Fire drill: a splash
• Unexpected change: more water

When it overflows → meltdown.

The trigger you see isn't the cause. It's the final drop.

### Tweet C (After-School Truth)
"Why does my child meltdown at home but hold it together at school?"

Because home is safe.

They've been masking all day. Bucket filling and filling.

Home is where they can finally release.

That after-school meltdown? It's trust, not a problem.

### Tweet D (Why Sound Works)
Most calming tools for meltdowns require something from your overwhelmed child:

• Touch tolerance
• Motor control
• Decision-making
• Engagement

Sound is different. It reaches the nervous system passively.

Press play. That's it.

### Tweet E (What NOT to Do)
Trying to reason with a child mid-meltdown is like trying to have a conversation with someone who's drowning.

They can't hear you. They're not ignoring you.

Their brain is in survival mode.

Stop talking. Ensure safety. Wait.
