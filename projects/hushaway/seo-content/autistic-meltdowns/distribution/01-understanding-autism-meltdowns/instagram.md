# Instagram Content: Autism Meltdowns

## Carousel: What's Really Happening During a Meltdown

### Slide 1: Cover
YOUR CHILD ISN'T
MISBEHAVING

Their brain is
overwhelmed

Swipe to understand what's really happening →

### Slide 2: The Truth
A meltdown isn't:

✗ Bad behaviour
✗ A tantrum
✗ Manipulation
✗ Something discipline will fix

It's neurological overflow.

### Slide 3: The Computer Analogy
Think of it like this:

Your child's brain is a computer asked to run too many programs at once.

It doesn't slow down gracefully.

It crashes.

### Slide 4: Meltdown ≠ Tantrum
TANTRUM
Goal-directed
Wants something
Watching your response

MELTDOWN
No goal
Overwhelmed system
Lost ability to regulate

### Slide 5: The Invisible Bucket
Your child has an invisible bucket that fills all day:

Scratchy uniform 💧
Noisy cafeteria 💧💧
Fire drill 💧💧💧
Unexpected change 💧💧

When it overflows → meltdown

### Slide 6: Why After-School Meltdowns
They held it together ALL DAY.

Bucket filling and filling.

Then they get home (safe space) and it all comes out.

Home isn't the problem.
Home is where they feel safe enough to release.

### Slide 7: What's Happening in Their Brain
During a meltdown:

The thinking part of the brain goes offline.

The survival brain takes over.

This is why reasoning doesn't work.

### Slide 8: Why Most Tools Fail
Weighted blankets → need touch tolerance
Fidget toys → need motor control
Breathing exercises → need cognitive processing

All of these require something from an already overwhelmed child.

### Slide 9: Why Sound Is Different
Sound reaches the nervous system without requiring anything.

No decisions.
No demands.
No effort.

Just press play.

### Slide 10: Your Job
Your job isn't to prevent all meltdowns (you can't).

It's to:
✓ Understand what's happening
✓ Respond helpfully, not harmfully
✓ Keep them safe
✓ Stop blaming yourself

## Caption

That meltdown isn't bad behaviour. It's neurological overflow.

.
.
.

You've been there. Your child is on the floor of the supermarket. Screaming. Maybe kicking. And that stranger is staring at you like you're the world's worst parent.

Here's what nobody tells you: A meltdown is what happens when your child's brain gets more input than it can process. Think computer crash, not defiance.

Research shows up to 90% of autistic individuals process sensory information differently. The sounds you barely notice might be painfully loud. The seams in their socks might feel like sandpaper all day. Fluorescent lights might flicker in a way only they perceive.

Imagine your child has an invisible bucket that fills throughout the day. Every sensory input, every social demand, every unexpected change adds water. When the bucket overflows, you get a meltdown.

The thing that appears to "cause" it (you asked them to brush teeth, took a different route home) is rarely the real cause. It's just the drop that made the bucket overflow.

This is why after-school meltdowns are so common. Your child held it together all day, their bucket filling and filling. Then they get home—their safe space—and it all comes out.

Understanding the difference between a meltdown and a tantrum changes everything. A tantrum is goal-directed (your child wants something). A meltdown has no goal (your child has lost the ability to regulate).

During a meltdown, trying to reason with your child is like trying to have a conversation with someone who's drowning. The thinking part of their brain is offline. Your job isn't to make it stop faster. It's to keep them safe until their nervous system can reset.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your child is on the floor screaming and everyone's staring. Here's what they don't know."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"A meltdown isn't bad behaviour. It's neurological overflow.

Think of your child's brain like a computer running too many programs. It doesn't slow down. It crashes.

Your child has an invisible bucket that fills all day. Sensory input. Social demands. Unexpected changes. Drop by drop.

When it overflows, meltdown.

The thing that looks like the 'trigger'? It's just the final drop. Not the real cause.

Your job isn't to make it stop faster. It's to keep them safe. Reduce sensory input. Stop talking. Wait.

The thinking part of their brain is offline. They're not ignoring you. They can't hear you."

**[25-30 seconds: CTA]**
"Understanding this changes everything. Follow for more autism support that gets it."

## Visual Notes

**Carousel Design:**
- Colour palette: Soft blues and warm beiges (calming, not overstimulating)
- Font: Large, clean sans-serif (minimum 40pt headlines)
- High contrast: Dark text on light background
- Minimal elements per slide (reduce visual clutter)
- Consistent layout across all slides

**Reel B-roll suggestions:**
- Parent sitting beside child (not hovering)
- Quiet, low-stimulus environment
- Visual representation of "bucket filling" (drops of water animation)
- Close-up of sound being played on phone/speaker
- Parent and child in calm moment after recovery

**Key visual hook for Reel:**
- Start with relatable moment: Parent looking exhausted in public space
- Quick cuts to show sensory overload from child's perspective (fast-paced, overwhelming)
- Transition to calm, explaining what's actually happening
- End with hope: parent and child in peaceful moment
