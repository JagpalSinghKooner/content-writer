# Instagram Content: The Complete Guide to Autism Meltdowns

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
EVERY GUIDE SAYS
"TRY CALMING MUSIC"

NONE TELL YOU
WHAT TO ACTUALLY PLAY

[Bold text, high contrast, minimal design]

### Slide 2: The Gap
The NHS has great guidance.

The National Autistic Society has excellent resources.

But both assume you know how to translate "use sensory tools" into something you can actually DO.

### Slide 3: What It Actually Is
A MELTDOWN IS:

✗ Not bad behaviour
✗ Not manipulation
✗ Not a tantrum

✓ A neurological event

The thinking brain goes offline.
This is why "calm down" doesn't work.

### Slide 4: Three Phases
PREVENTION
Reading warning signs
Building daily regulation

DURING
The crisis itself
What to do (and avoid)

RECOVERY
The hours after
Rebuilding capacity

Most advice only focuses on "during."

### Slide 5: The Bucket Truth
The socks didn't cause it.

They were the 10th trigger that day.

→ Scratchy jumper
→ Noisy cafeteria
→ Substitute teacher
→ Sibling breathing loudly
→ Wrong socks

When the bucket overflows = meltdown

### Slide 6: During a Meltdown
DO:
✓ Reduce sensory input
✓ Stop talking
✓ Ensure safety
✓ Wait

DON'T:
✗ Reason or explain
✗ Ask questions
✗ Make demands
✗ Punish

### Slide 7: What to Play
BROWN NOISE + PINK NOISE
Deep, consistent sound

LOW-FREQUENCY SOUNDS
Below 500Hz (grounding)

ASMR SOUNDS
Gentle tapping, soft brushing

AVOID:
Lyrics, unpredictable changes, high-pitched sounds

### Slide 8: Why Sound Works
Most tools require something:

Weighted blankets → touch tolerance
Fidget toys → motor control
Breathing exercises → cognitive processing

SOUND → requires NOTHING

Just press play.

### Slide 9: After-School Meltdowns
Holds it together all day ✓
Teacher says they're fine ✓
Walks through door → EXPLODES

They've been masking all day.
By home time, nothing's left.

Create a transition zone.
Low demands. Just space.

## Caption

Every guide says "try calming music" during autism meltdowns.

What music? Which sounds? At what volume? When they're kicking and thrashing, do you just hold up your phone and hope for the best?

Nobody answers.

.
.
.

Here's what I wish someone had told me when we were drowning.

Meltdowns aren't single events. They have three phases: Prevention (before), During (the crisis), and Recovery (after). Most advice focuses entirely on "during" because it's the dramatic part. But prevention can reduce how often meltdowns happen. And recovery, done poorly, can trigger another meltdown within hours.

The socks didn't cause the meltdown. They were the tenth trigger that day. Every sensory input, every social demand, every small frustration adds water to an invisible bucket. The "cause" wasn't the final drop. It was everything that came before.

Sound support works when other tools fail because it doesn't require anything from your child. No holding. No interaction. No decisions. Just press play. But "calming music" often doesn't work because it has lyrics (adds cognitive load), unpredictable changes (feels threatening), or wasn't designed with sensory sensitivities in mind.

Brown noise, pink noise, and low-frequency sounds tend to work better. Consistent. Predictable. Safe.

The gap between knowing what a meltdown is and knowing what to do feels enormous. But it doesn't have to be.

You deserve better than vague advice. Your child deserves tools that actually work.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Every autism guide says 'try calming music.' Here's what they don't tell you."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"Brown noise and pink noise work better than music with lyrics.

Why? Because lyrics require cognitive processing. And during a meltdown? The thinking brain is offline.

Low-frequency sounds below 500Hz feel grounding. ASMR sounds like gentle tapping or soft brushing can help.

But here's the key: Sound doesn't require anything from your child. No holding. No interaction. Just press play.

Most calming tools require something they can't give when they're overwhelmed. Sound is different."
