# Twitter/X Content: What to Play During an Autism Meltdown

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your autistic child is mid-meltdown.

You're searching your phone with shaking hands.

Here's exactly what sounds work (and what makes things worse)

🧵 A thread on calming sounds for autism meltdowns:

### Tweet 2
First: why sound works when other tools fail.

When your child is mid-meltdown, their thinking brain has gone offline.

Weighted blankets? Need touch tolerance.
Breathing exercises? Need cognitive processing.
Fidgets? Need motor control.

Sound bypasses all of this.

### Tweet 3
1. BROWN NOISE & PINK NOISE

Deep, consistent, predictable. Think:
• Heavy rain on a roof
• Distant waterfall
• Plane in flight

No surprises. No sudden changes. Just a consistent sound blanket that masks unpredictable environmental noise.

### Tweet 4
2. LOW-FREQUENCY SOUNDS

Below 500Hz. Physically grounding.

Some parents swear by Solfeggio frequencies (396Hz, 528Hz).

What matters most: consistency and lack of surprise. The overwhelmed nervous system needs something predictable to anchor to.

3. ASMR SOUNDS (for some children)

Gentle tapping, soft brushing, quiet rustling, slow pouring water.

Not everyone responds. Some find it irritating.

But for those who do? It can be remarkably effective.

Test when calm to find out.

### Tweet 6
WHAT TO AVOID:

✗ Music with lyrics (adds cognitive load)
✗ High-pitched sounds (can feel painful)
✗ Unpredictable changes (more processing)
✗ Complete silence (lets every sound through)

Wordless, consistent, low-frequency always wins.

### Tweet 7
HOW TO INTRODUCE SOUND:

1. Have it ready BEFORE you need it
2. Start quietly, increase gradually
3. Don't announce it (just press play)
4. Give it time (minutes, not seconds)
5. Keep it consistent (don't switch tracks)

### Tweet 8
The critical piece most parents miss:

Test sounds when your child is CALM, not during crisis.

Play them during quiet time, wind-down, before sleep.

The sounds that help when they're regulated are likely to help during overwhelm.

### Tweet 9
Sound won't stop a meltdown instantly. Nothing does.

The goal isn't to end the meltdown immediately.

It's to give the nervous system something consistent to land on while the overwhelm runs its course.

### Tweet 10
Many parents give up too quickly.

They try one "calming music" track. It doesn't work. They write off sound entirely.

But brown noise ≠ meditation music ≠ ASMR sounds ≠ Solfeggio frequencies.

Different sounds work for different children. Build a toolkit.

### Tweet 11 (Wrap)
TL;DR on sounds for autism meltdowns:

• Brown/pink noise (most reliable)
• Low-frequency sounds (grounding)
• ASMR (works for some)
• Test when calm, not crisis
• Start quiet, stay consistent
• Give it time to work

Sound isn't magic. But for many, it's the tool that works when everything else fails.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (The Crisis Hook)
It's 2am. Your autistic child is screaming.

You've been told "try calming music."

But what music? Which track? At what volume?

Brown noise. That's the answer. Deep, consistent, predictable. No lyrics, no surprises.

Start quietly and just let it play.

### Tweet B (The Mechanism)
Why sound works for autism meltdowns when other tools fail:

Weighted blankets → need touch tolerance
Breathing exercises → need cognitive processing
Fidgets → need motor control

Sound → bypasses all of this. No demands. Just press play.

That's the power of passive listening.

### Tweet C (The Mistake)
Unpopular autism parenting take:

Most parents give up on sound too quickly.

They try one "calming music" track. It doesn't work. They write off sound entirely.

But brown noise ≠ meditation music ≠ ASMR ≠ Solfeggio frequencies.

Different sounds work for different children.

### Tweet D (The Test)
The secret to using sound during autism meltdowns:

Test sounds when your child is CALM, not during crisis.

Play them during quiet time, wind-down, before sleep.

The sounds that help when they're regulated are likely to help during overwhelm.

Don't wait for crisis to experiment.

### Tweet E (Quick List)
Sounds that help autism meltdowns:
✓ Brown noise
✓ Pink noise
✓ Low-frequency sounds (below 500Hz)
✓ ASMR (for some)

Sounds that make it worse:
✗ Music with lyrics
✗ High-pitched sounds
✗ Unpredictable changes
✗ Complete silence

Consistent, predictable, low-frequency wins.
