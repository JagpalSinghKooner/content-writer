# Instagram Content: What to Play During an Autism Meltdown

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
**YOUR CHILD IS MID-MELTDOWN**

**What do you play?**

Swipe for the sounds that actually work →

### Slide 2: Why Sound Works
When meltdown hits, the thinking brain goes offline.

Weighted blankets? Need touch tolerance.
Breathing? Needs cognitive processing.
Fidgets? Need motor control.

**Sound bypasses all of this.**

No demands. Just press play.

### Slide 3: Brown & Pink Noise
The most reliable starting point.

Deep. Consistent. Predictable.

✓ Heavy rain on a roof
✓ Distant waterfall
✓ Plane in flight

No surprises = nervous system can predict what comes next.

### Slide 4: Low-Frequency Sounds
Below 500Hz = physically grounding.

Some parents love Solfeggio frequencies (396Hz, 528Hz).

What matters most: CONSISTENCY.

The overwhelmed nervous system needs something predictable to anchor to.

### Slide 5: ASMR Sounds
Soft, gentle sounds:

• Tapping
• Brushing
• Rustling
• Pouring water

Not for everyone. But when it works? Powerful.

### Slide 6: What NOT to Play
✗ Music with lyrics
✗ High-pitched sounds
✗ Unpredictable changes
✗ Complete silence

Wordless.
Consistent.
Low-frequency.

Always.

### Slide 7: How to Introduce It
1. Have it ready BEFORE crisis
2. Start quietly
3. Don't announce it
4. Give it TIME (minutes, not seconds)
5. Stay consistent (don't switch tracks)

### Slide 8: The Critical Test
Test sounds when your child is CALM.

Not during crisis.

Play during:
• Quiet time
• Wind-down
• Before sleep

What helps when calm → helps during overwhelm.

### Slide 9: Be Patient
Sound won't stop a meltdown instantly.

**Nothing does.**

The goal: give the nervous system something to land on while overwhelm runs its course.

### Slide 10: Your Toolkit
Many parents give up too quickly.

One track doesn't work → they write off sound entirely.

But brown noise ≠ ASMR ≠ frequencies.

Build a toolkit. Find what works for YOUR child.

## Caption

Your child is mid-meltdown.

You're searching your phone with shaking hands.

"Have you tried calming music?"

But what music? Which track? At what volume?

.
.
.

Here's what actually works:

Brown noise and pink noise. Deep, consistent, predictable. Heavy rain on a roof. A distant waterfall. No surprises. No sudden changes.

Why sound works when other tools fail: it bypasses all the demands. Weighted blankets need touch tolerance. Breathing exercises need cognitive processing. Fidgets need motor control. All unavailable mid-meltdown.

Sound reaches the nervous system without asking anything of your child. No demands. Just press play.

The critical piece most parents miss: test sounds when your child is calm, not during crisis. Play them during quiet time, wind-down, before sleep. The sounds that help when they're regulated are likely to help during overwhelm.

But you need to discover what those are before you need them.

Sound isn't magic. But for many autistic children, it's the tool that works when everything else fails.

What sounds work for your child during difficult moments?

## Visual Notes

**Carousel Design:**
- Colours: Soft blues and warm neutrals (calming palette)
- Font: Sans-serif, highly readable (minimum 24pt body, 40pt+ headlines)
- Consistent design system across all slides
- High contrast throughout
- Minimal elements per slide (one main point)

**Reel B-roll Suggestions:**
- Visual of rain falling (for brown noise example)
- Parent's hand holding phone (crisis moment)
- Child in calm state with sound playing (showing the test phase)
- Sound wave visualization (to show consistency vs unpredictability)
- Avoid showing distressed children directly (respect and sensitivity)
