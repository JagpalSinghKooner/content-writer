# LinkedIn Content: What to Play During an Autism Meltdown

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
**Your child is mid-meltdown.**

**You're searching your phone for something that might help.**

**Here's exactly what to play →**

### Slide 2: Why Sound Works
When your child is mid-meltdown, their thinking brain has gone offline.

Weighted blankets? Need them to tolerate touch.
Breathing exercises? Need cognitive processing.
Fidgets? Need motor control.

Sound bypasses all of this. No demands. Just press play.

### Slide 3: Brown & Pink Noise
The most reliable starting point for most autistic children.

Consistent, predictable, low-frequency. No surprises.

Think: heavy rain on a roof, distant waterfall, plane in flight.

Brown noise masks unpredictable environmental sounds that add to overwhelm.

### Slide 4: Low-Frequency Sounds
Certain frequencies help regulate the nervous system.

Low-frequency sounds (below 500Hz) feel physically grounding.

Some parents find Solfeggio frequencies helpful (396Hz, 528Hz).

Consistency matters more than specific frequency.

### Slide 5: ASMR Sounds
Soft, gentle sounds some find deeply calming:

• Gentle tapping
• Soft brushing
• Quiet rustling
• Slow pouring water

Not for everyone. But when it works? Remarkably effective.

### Slide 6: What NOT to Play
Music with lyrics → Adds cognitive load
High-pitched sounds → Can feel painful
Unpredictable changes → Brain has to process shifts
Complete silence → Lets every other sound through

Wordless, consistent, low-frequency always wins.

### Slide 7: How to Introduce Sound
1. Have it ready BEFORE you need it (create a playlist now)
2. Start quietly, increase gradually if needed
3. Don't announce it (just press play)
4. Give it time (minutes, not seconds)
5. Keep it consistent (don't keep switching tracks)

### Slide 8: The Critical Piece
Test sounds when your child is calm, not during crisis.

Introduce during quiet time, wind-down, before sleep.

The sounds that help when they're regulated are likely to help during overwhelm.

### Slide 9: Quick Reference
**DO:**
✓ Brown noise, pink noise, low frequencies
✓ Start quietly
✓ Keep it consistent
✓ Give it time

**DON'T:**
✗ Music with lyrics
✗ Blast it suddenly
✗ Keep switching sounds
✗ Use unpredictable elements

### Slide 10: CTA
Sound isn't magic. But for many autistic children, it's the tool that works when everything else fails.

## Text Post 1

You're searching your phone at 2am.

Your autistic child is screaming. Or sobbing. Or rigid and unreachable.

"Have you tried calming music?" everyone says.

But what music? Which track? At what volume?

Here's what actually works:

**Brown noise or pink noise.** Deep, consistent, predictable. Think heavy rain on a roof or a distant waterfall. No surprises. No sudden changes. Just a consistent sound blanket that masks unpredictable environmental noise.

**Low-frequency sounds.** Below 500Hz. Physically grounding. Some parents swear by Solfeggio frequencies (396Hz, 528Hz). What matters most is consistency and lack of surprise.

**ASMR sounds for some children.** Gentle tapping, soft brushing, quiet rustling. Not everyone responds, but when it works, it's powerful.

**What to avoid:** Music with lyrics (adds cognitive load). High-pitched sounds (can feel painful). Unpredictable changes (more for the brain to process). Complete silence (lets every other sound through).

Why sound works when other tools fail:

Weighted blankets need your child to tolerate touch. Breathing exercises need cognitive processing. Fidgets need motor control. All unavailable mid-meltdown.

Sound bypasses all of this. No demands. Your child doesn't need to hold anything. Do anything. Engage with anything. They just need to be within hearing distance.

The critical piece most parents miss: test sounds when your child is calm, not during crisis. Play them during quiet time, wind-down, before sleep. The sounds that help when they're regulated are likely to help during overwhelm.

But you need to discover what those are before you need them.

Sound isn't magic. But for many autistic children, it's the tool that works when everything else fails.

What's your experience with sound during meltdowns?

## Text Post 2

I've spoken to hundreds of parents of autistic children.

The ones who keep sound as their go-to tool all say the same thing:

"I gave up on it too quickly the first time."

They tried one "calming music" track from YouTube. It didn't work. They wrote off sound entirely.

Here's what they wish they'd known:

**Not all sounds are equal.** Random "calming music" playlists often have lyrics (cognitive load), unpredictable changes (more processing), or high-pitched elements (can feel painful during overwhelm).

What works: Brown noise. Pink noise. Low-frequency sounds. Consistent, predictable, no surprises.

**Volume matters.** Don't blast sound into a crisis. Start quieter than you think. Increase gradually only if it seems to help. Sudden loud sound adds sensory input—exactly what you don't want.

**It needs time.** Sound won't stop a meltdown instantly. Nothing does. The goal isn't to end the meltdown immediately. It's to give the nervous system something consistent to anchor to while the overwhelm runs its course.

**The critical test happens when calm.** Introduce different sound types during quiet time, wind-down, or before sleep. Notice what your child seems to respond to. Ask them if they're verbal: "Does this sound feel nice or not nice?"

The sounds that help when they're regulated are likely to help during overwhelm. But you need to discover what those are before you need them.

Many parents find sound becomes their most reliable tool once they find what works for their specific child.

Have you found a sound type that works for your child during difficult moments?
