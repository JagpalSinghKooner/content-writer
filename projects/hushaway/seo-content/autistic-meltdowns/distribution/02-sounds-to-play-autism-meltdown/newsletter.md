# Newsletter Snippet: What to Play During an Autism Meltdown

## Hook

You're in the thick of it right now. Your child is screaming, or sobbing, or rigid and unreachable. And you're searching your phone for something—anything—that might help.

## Body

"Have you tried calming music?" You've heard that advice a hundred times. But what music? Which track? At what volume?

Here's what research and thousands of parent experiences tell us actually works: brown noise and pink noise. Deep, consistent, predictable. Think of heavy rain on a roof or a distant waterfall. No surprises. No sudden changes. Just a consistent sound blanket.

Why sound works when other tools fail: it bypasses all the demands that other calming tools require. Weighted blankets need your child to tolerate touch. Breathing exercises need cognitive processing. Fidgets need motor control. All unavailable mid-meltdown. Sound reaches the nervous system without asking anything of your child.

The critical piece most parents miss: test sounds when your child is calm, not during crisis. Play them during quiet time, wind-down, or before sleep. The sounds that help when they're regulated are likely to help during overwhelm. But you need to discover what those are before you need them.

## CTA

Sound isn't magic. But for many autistic children, it's the tool that works when everything else fails.
