# Instagram Content: Preventing Autism Meltdowns

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
IT WASN'T
THE SOCKS

(It was never about the socks)

### Slide 2: The Reality
Your child melted down this morning.

Over socks.

Wrong seams.
Wrong colour.
Somehow just wrong.

And you wondered: how is THIS the thing that broke them?

### Slide 3: The Truth
That sock moment wasn't the cause.

It was the TENTH thing that day.

• Loud alarm
• Breakfast touching
• Sibling too close
• Tag in shirt
• Routine change

Drop. Drop. Drop. Drop. Drop.

Then: socks.

### Slide 4: The Bucket
Think of your child's nervous system as a BUCKET.

Every sensory input adds water.

Every demand.
Every frustration.
Every small thing.

Splash after splash after splash.

### Slide 5: A Typical School Day
What the morning added:

• Scratchy jumper (splash)
• Assembly echo (more water)
• Child sat too close (splash)
• Substitute teacher (big pour)
• Playground noise (drip drip drip)
• Unclear homework (nearly full)

Then they come home. And you ask for different socks.

### Slide 6: The Overflow
The sock didn't fill the bucket.

The sock was just the drop that made it OVERFLOW.

This is why meltdowns seem unpredictable.

"But they've worn those socks a hundred times!"

Yes. But those times, the bucket wasn't already at the brim.

### Slide 7: Warning Signs
Before meltdowns, there's the "rumbling stage."

Physical warnings:
• Increased fidgeting
• Covering ears more
• Faster breathing
• Tensing up
• Flushing or pale

The bucket is nearly full. You just can't see it yet.

### Slide 8: More Warning Signs
Behavioural shifts:
• Rigid about small things
• Saying "no" to everything
• Withdrawal or hiding
• Seeking OR avoiding sensory input
• Taking longer to respond
• Getting stuck on one topic

Learn YOUR child's pattern.

### Slide 9: You Can't Eliminate Everything
Life has seams in socks.

Fluorescent lights.
Fire drills.
Siblings who breathe too loudly.

The goal isn't a trigger-free life.

The goal is a bucket that EMPTIES faster than it fills.

### Slide 10: Daily Prevention
Build regulation into the day:

Morning: Gentle wake
After school: Decompress FIRST
Homework: Passive support
Evening: Wind-down early

Five minutes here.
Ten minutes there.

The bucket empties a bit at every opportunity.

### Slide 11: Why Sound Works
Sound works as PREVENTION, not just crisis intervention.

Your child doesn't need to recognise they're stressed for sound to help regulate stress.

No interaction.
No decisions.
No effort.

Just press play.

## Caption

It wasn't the socks.

You know exactly what I mean. Your child had a complete meltdown this morning. Over socks. The seams were wrong. Or the colour was wrong. Or they were the right socks but somehow also wrong.

And somewhere in the chaos, you wondered: how is this the thing that broke them?

.
.
.

Here's what nobody tells you about preventing autism meltdowns. That sock moment wasn't the cause. It was the tenth thing that day.

The alarm that was too loud. The breakfast that touched on the plate. The sibling who breathed too close. The tag in the shirt. The change in routine you forgot to mention. Drop after drop after drop. Then the socks.

Think of your child's nervous system as a bucket. Every sensory input, every social demand, every small frustration adds water to that bucket. The sock didn't fill the bucket. The sock was just the drop that made it overflow.

.
.
.

This is why meltdowns can seem so unpredictable. "But they've worn those socks a hundred times!" Yes. But those hundred other times, the bucket wasn't already at the brim.

Understanding this changes everything. You can't eliminate every trigger. You'd drive yourself mad trying. But you can keep the bucket from overflowing before the socks even come out of the drawer.

.
.
.

The shift that changes everything: stop trying to eliminate triggers. Start building regulation throughout the day.

Morning transition. After-school reset. Homework background. Evening wind-down. Small moments of calm, of sensory reset, of nervous system support. Five minutes here. Ten minutes there. The bucket empties a little at each opportunity.

Most parents discover sound during or after meltdowns. But sound works better as prevention than as crisis intervention. Your child doesn't need to recognise they're stressed for sound to help regulate stress. No interaction. No decisions. No effort. Just press play.

.
.
.

Before every meltdown, there's a warning period. The "rumbling stage." The bucket is nearly full but hasn't overflowed yet. Learning to spot it is your biggest opportunity for preventing autism meltdowns.

Physical signs: increased fidgeting, covering ears more, faster breathing, tensing up, flushing or pale. Behavioural shifts: rigid about small things, saying "no" to everything, withdrawal, taking longer to respond. Verbal cues: repeating phrases, voice changing pitch, saying "I can't" repeatedly.

Your child might move through these stages in minutes. Or slowly over hours. What matters is learning your child's specific pattern. Because once you can spot the rumble, you can intervene before the meltdown.

.
.
.

The goal isn't a meltdown-free life. The goal is a nervous system that can handle more. A bucket that empties faster than it fills. A baseline of regulation that gives your child capacity for the inevitable challenges.

It was never about the socks.
