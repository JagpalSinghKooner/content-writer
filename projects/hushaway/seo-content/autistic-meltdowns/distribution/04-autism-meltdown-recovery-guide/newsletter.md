# Newsletter Snippet: After the Meltdown: What Actually Helps Your Autistic Child Recover

## Hook

The screaming has stopped. The thrashing is over. Your child is quiet now.

But they're not okay. You can see it in their eyes.

## Body

Everyone talks about what to do during a meltdown. The internet is full of advice about calming techniques and crisis management. But almost nobody talks about what comes after. The invisible hours. The fragile period where everything can tip back into chaos.

Here's what nobody tells you: the visible meltdown is only part of the story. Often, it's not even the hardest part.

A meltdown isn't just an emotional outburst. It's a neurological event. Your child's nervous system went into overdrive. Their stress hormones spiked. Their thinking brain went offline. You can't expect a nervous system to bounce back immediately.

Parents call it the "meltdown hangover." That foggy, fragile state that can last for hours after the visible crisis ends. Your child might seem spacey, irritable at the smallest things, unusually sensitive to sounds or touch. Quick to tip back over into another meltdown from almost nothing.

Recovery isn't instant. It can take hours. Sometimes days. And how you handle the aftermath matters just as much as how you handle the meltdown itself.

We've written a complete guide to supporting your child through the recovery phase — what helps, what doesn't, and why the hours after matter so much.

P.S. One more thing the article covers: you need recovery time too. Your nervous system was activated as well. There's a section specifically about helping yourself recover — because you can't pour from an empty cup.

• Physical exhaustion that's genuinely real (not being dramatic)
• Emotional fragility where anything can trigger round two
• Cognitive fog where simple instructions feel impossible
• Shame and memory gaps that make children withdraw
• What actually helps during those fragile hours
• Why you need recovery time too

The meltdown ended. But the recovery is just beginning.
