# LinkedIn Content: After the Meltdown: What Actually Helps Your Autistic Child Recover

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
The meltdown ended.

But your child's still not okay.

(And nobody talks about this part)

Swipe → to understand the invisible recovery phase

### Slide 2: The Meltdown Hangover Is Real
The visible meltdown is only part of the story.

A meltdown isn't just an emotional outburst — it's a neurological event. Your child's stress hormones spiked. Their thinking brain went offline.

You can't expect a nervous system to bounce back immediately.

### Slide 3: Physical Exhaustion
Meltdowns are physically demanding.

Your child might be genuinely tired in a way that sleep alone won't fix.

They might want to lie down. Move slowly. Need more support than usual.

This isn't them being dramatic. Their body genuinely needs rest.

### Slide 4: Shame & Memory Gaps
Older children may feel deeply ashamed about what happened.

Many don't fully remember. The survival brain doesn't store memories the same way.

When you ask "why did you do that?" and they say "I don't know," they're often telling the truth.

### Slide 5: What Helps
✓ Give time before talking
✓ Keep demands low (way lower than you think)
✓ Offer without requiring ("Water's here if you want it")
✓ Create sensory safety (dim lights, reduce noise)
✓ Use sound as ongoing support

### Slide 6: What Doesn't Help
✗ Immediate debriefing ("Why did you do that?")
✗ Punishment or consequences
✗ Forced apologies
✗ Acting like nothing happened

These add pressure when the nervous system is still recovering.

### Slide 7: Recovery Takes Time
Sometimes hours. Sometimes days.

The bigger the storm, the longer the recovery.

Keep demands low. Maintain sensory safety. Give it time.

### Slide 8: You Need Recovery Too
Meltdowns affect you as well.

Your nervous system was activated. Your stress hormones spiked.

Take time for yourself once things settle. You can't pour from an empty cup.

### Slide 9: Summary
After a meltdown:
1. Physical exhaustion is real
2. Shame and memory gaps are normal
3. Give time before talking
4. Keep demands very low
5. Sound can support ongoing recovery

The screaming has stopped. The thrashing is over. Your child is quiet now.

But they're not okay. You can see it in their eyes.

Here's what nobody tells you about the hours after an autistic meltdown.

The visible meltdown is only part of the story. Often, it's not even the hardest part.

A meltdown isn't just an emotional outburst. It's a neurological event. Your child's nervous system went into overdrive. Their stress hormones spiked. Their thinking brain went offline.

You can't put a nervous system through that kind of storm and expect it to bounce back immediately.

Parents call it the "meltdown hangover." That foggy, fragile state that can last for hours after the visible crisis ends.

Here's what recovery actually looks like:

1. **Physical exhaustion** — Their body genuinely needs rest. Meltdowns are physically demanding.

2. **Emotional fragility** — Things that would normally be fine can feel impossible. The threshold for another meltdown drops dramatically.

3. **Cognitive fog** — They might seem confused, forgetful, unable to follow simple instructions. The thinking brain is still coming back online.

4. **Shame and embarrassment** — Older children especially may feel deeply ashamed about what happened. They might remember things they said or did and feel awful about them.

5. **Memory gaps** — Many children don't fully remember what happened. When you ask "why did you do that?" and they say "I don't know," they're often telling the truth.

What actually helps during recovery:

→ Give time before talking (resist the urge to debrief immediately)
→ Keep demands low (way lower than you think necessary)
→ Offer without requiring ("Water's here if you want it")
→ Create sensory safety (dim lights, reduce noise)
→ Use sound as ongoing support (gentle frequencies, soft soundscapes)

What doesn't help:

✗ Immediate debriefing ("Can you tell me what happened?")
✗ Punishment or consequences
✗ Forced apologies
✗ Acting like nothing happened

Recovery isn't instant. It can take hours. Sometimes days. And how you handle the aftermath matters just as much as how you handle the meltdown itself.

One more thing: you need recovery time too. Witnessing your child in distress takes something out of you. Every single time.

If you can, take time for yourself once things settle. This isn't selfish. It's necessary.

What's been your experience with the recovery phase? I'd love to hear what's worked for you.

"Why does my child have another meltdown so soon after the first one ends?"

This question breaks my heart every time I hear it.

Here's what's actually happening.

The nervous system is depleted after a meltdown. The "buffer" that normally absorbs small frustrations is gone.

Things that would usually be manageable can tip them back over because there's no capacity left.

It's like expecting someone to run a marathon, then immediately run another one because they "recovered" enough to stand up.

Your child might seem fine on the surface. But underneath, they're still in recovery mode.

What looks like recovery might be a temporary plateau before another dip.

This is especially true after:
→ Major meltdowns
→ Clusters of meltdowns close together
→ Meltdowns in particularly stressful contexts (school, public places)

The bigger the storm, the longer the recovery.

So what do you do?

Keep demands very low. Avoid anything that requires significant cognitive or emotional effort until they've genuinely recovered.

That homework? Can wait.
That bath? Can wait.
That conversation about what happened? Definitely can wait.

This isn't "letting them off." It's recognising that their capacity is genuinely reduced right now.

You're not being soft. You're being realistic about what their nervous system can handle.

Recovery takes time. Sometimes more time than you'd expect. And that's okay.

Have you noticed this pattern with your child? What helps during those fragile hours?

One thing about meltdown recovery that nobody prepared me for:

The shame.

Not the child's shame (though that's real and heartbreaking).

My own shame. As a parent.

Did I handle that right? Should I have seen it coming? What if someone heard us? What if I made it worse?

The self-doubt that creeps in during those quiet hours after the storm.

Here's what I've learned: your child isn't the only one who needs recovery time.

You do too.

Meltdowns don't just affect your child. They affect you. Witnessing your child in distress. Managing a crisis situation. Absorbing intense emotions while trying to stay calm.

It takes something out of you. Every single time.

Your nervous system was activated too. Your stress hormones spiked. You might feel shaky, exhausted, emotional, or strangely numb.

This is normal. You're not failing. You're human.

If you can, take time for yourself once things settle. A cup of tea alone. A few minutes outside. A moment to breathe without anyone needing anything from you.

This isn't selfish. It's necessary.

You can't pour from an empty cup. And you'll be better able to support your child's recovery if you've taken care of your own, even a little bit.

The meltdown ended. But the recovery is still happening.

For both of you.

What helps you recover after supporting your child through a meltdown? I'd love to hear your strategies.
