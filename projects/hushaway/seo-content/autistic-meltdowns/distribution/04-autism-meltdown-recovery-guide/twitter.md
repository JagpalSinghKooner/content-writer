# Twitter/X Content: After the Meltdown: What Actually Helps Your Autistic Child Recover

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
The meltdown ended.

But your child's still not okay.

Nobody talks about the hours after. The invisible recovery phase that can last longer than the meltdown itself.

Here's what's actually happening (and what helps):

🧵

### Tweet 2
1. THE MELTDOWN HANGOVER

A meltdown isn't just an emotional outburst. It's a neurological event.

Your child's stress hormones spiked. Their thinking brain went offline.

You can't expect a nervous system to bounce back immediately.

### Tweet 3
2. PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION

Meltdowns are physically demanding.

Your child might be genuinely tired in a way that sleep alone won't fix. They might want to lie down. Move slowly.

This isn't them being dramatic. Their body genuinely needs rest.

### Tweet 4
3. EMOTIONAL FRAGILITY

The threshold for another meltdown drops dramatically after a recent one.

Things that would normally be fine can feel impossible.

The "buffer" that normally absorbs small frustrations is gone. It takes time to rebuild.

### Tweet 5
4. COGNITIVE FOG

Your child might seem confused. Forgetful. Unable to follow instructions that are normally easy.

This isn't defiance. The thinking brain is still coming back online after being offline during the meltdown.

Give it time.

### Tweet 6
5. SHAME & MEMORY GAPS

Many children don't fully remember what happened during a meltdown.

When you ask "why did you do that?" and they say "I don't know," they're often telling the truth.

Older children may feel deeply ashamed. This shame can make them withdraw.

### Tweet 7
WHAT HELPS:

→ Give time before talking (hours, not minutes)
→ Keep demands LOW (way lower than you think)
→ Offer without requiring ("Water's here if you want it")
→ Create sensory safety (dim lights, reduce noise)
→ Use sound as ongoing support

### Tweet 8
WHAT DOESN'T HELP:

✗ Immediate debriefing ("Why did you do that?")
✗ Punishment or consequences
✗ Forced apologies
✗ Acting like nothing happened

These add pressure when the nervous system is still recovering.

### Tweet 9
Recovery can take hours. Sometimes days.

The bigger the storm, the longer the recovery.

If your child has another meltdown soon after the first, it's not because you did something wrong.

It's because the nervous system is depleted. The buffer is gone.

### Tweet 10
One more thing:

You need recovery time too.

Your nervous system was activated. Your stress hormones spiked.

Take time for yourself once things settle. A cup of tea alone. A few minutes outside.

This isn't selfish. It's necessary.

### Tweet 11 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Meltdown hangover is real
• Physical exhaustion + cognitive fog are normal
• Give time before talking
• Keep demands very low
• Sound can support ongoing recovery
• You need recovery too

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
The hardest part of an autism meltdown isn't the screaming.

It's the hours after.

When your child is quiet but not okay. When everything feels fragile. When you're wondering if you should talk about it or leave them alone.

Nobody prepares you for the invisible recovery phase.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

Talking to your child about the meltdown immediately after it happens makes things worse, not better.

They're not being difficult. Their thinking brain is still offline.

Wait. Give them hours to recover. Sometimes a full day.

### Tweet C (Parent Reality)
You know what nobody tells you about autism meltdowns?

You need recovery time too.

Not just your child. You.

Your nervous system was activated. Your stress hormones spiked. You're exhausted.

Taking 10 minutes for yourself after isn't selfish. It's necessary.

### Tweet D (The Question)
"Why does my child have another meltdown so soon after the first one?"

The nervous system is depleted. The buffer that normally absorbs small frustrations is gone.

Things that would usually be manageable can tip them back over.

This is normal after significant meltdowns.

### Tweet E (Memory Gaps)
When your autistic child says "I don't know" after a meltdown, they're often telling the truth.

The survival brain doesn't store memories the same way.

They might genuinely not remember what happened or why they did what they did.

Stop asking them to explain.
