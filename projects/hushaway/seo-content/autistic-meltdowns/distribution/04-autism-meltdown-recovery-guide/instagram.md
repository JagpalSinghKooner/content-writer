# Instagram Content: After the Meltdown: What Actually Helps Your Autistic Child Recover

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
THE MELTDOWN ENDED

but your child's
still not okay

(Nobody talks about this part)

### Slide 2: The Invisible Phase
Everyone talks about what to do DURING a meltdown.

Nobody mentions the hours after.

The invisible recovery phase that can last longer than the meltdown itself.

### Slide 3: The Meltdown Hangover
A meltdown isn't just an emotional outburst.

It's a neurological event.

Your child's stress hormones spiked. Their thinking brain went offline.

You can't expect a nervous system to bounce back immediately.

### Slide 4: What You'll See
Physical exhaustion
(genuinely tired)

Emotional fragility
(another meltdown from almost nothing)

Cognitive fog
(can't follow simple instructions)

Shame & memory gaps
("I don't know why I did that")

### Slide 5: What Helps
✓ Give time before talking
(hours, not minutes)

✓ Keep demands LOW
(way lower than you think)

✓ Offer without requiring
("Water's here if you want it")

### Slide 6: What Helps (2)
✓ Create sensory safety
(dim lights, reduce noise)

✓ Use sound as ongoing support
(gentle frequencies, soft soundscapes)

✓ Be present, not intrusive

### Slide 7: What Doesn't Help
✗ Immediate debriefing
("Why did you do that?")

✗ Punishment or consequences

✗ Forced apologies

✗ Acting like nothing happened

### Slide 8: Recovery Takes Time
Sometimes hours.

Sometimes days.

The bigger the storm, the longer the recovery.

This is normal. Give it time.

### Slide 9: You Need Recovery Too
Meltdowns affect you as well.

Your nervous system was activated.
Your stress hormones spiked.

Take time for yourself once things settle.

You can't pour from an empty cup.

### Slide 10: CTA

## Caption

The meltdown ended. But your child's still not okay.

.
.
.

Here's what nobody tells you about the hours after an autistic meltdown.

The visible meltdown is only part of the story. Often, it's not even the hardest part.

Parents call it the "meltdown hangover." That foggy, fragile state that can last for hours after the visible crisis ends.

Your child might seem spacey. Irritable at the smallest things. Unusually sensitive to sounds or touch. Quick to tip back over into another meltdown from almost nothing.

What's actually happening: A meltdown is a neurological event. Your child's nervous system went into overdrive. Their stress hormones spiked. Their thinking brain went offline.

You can't put a nervous system through that kind of storm and expect it to bounce back immediately.

What helps during recovery:
→ Give time before talking (resist the urge to debrief)
→ Keep demands low (homework can wait, bath can wait)
→ Offer without requiring ("Water's here if you want it")
→ Create sensory safety (dim lights, reduce noise)
→ Use sound as ongoing support

What doesn't help:
✗ Immediate debriefing
✗ Punishment or consequences
✗ Forced apologies
✗ Acting like nothing happened

Recovery can take hours. Sometimes days. And how you handle the aftermath matters just as much as how you handle the meltdown itself.

One more thing: you need recovery time too. Your nervous system was activated as well. Take time for yourself once things settle. This isn't selfish. It's necessary.
