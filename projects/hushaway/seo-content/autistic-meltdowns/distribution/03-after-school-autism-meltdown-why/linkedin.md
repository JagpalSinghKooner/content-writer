### Slide 1: Hook
**3:47pm. Your child walks out of school.**

Fine. Smiling, even.

**15 minutes later:**
Screaming on the kitchen floor.

Swipe → to understand why

### Slide 2: It's Not You
Your child isn't saving their worst behaviour for home.

They're not manipulating you.

They're not punishing you.

They've been holding themselves together for six hours.

You're watching what happens when they can't hold on any longer.

### Slide 3: The Invisible Labour
What a school day costs an autistic child:

• Suppressing the urge to cover their ears
• Forcing eye contact that feels physically uncomfortable
• Not moving when their body needs to move
• Hiding confusion when instructions don't make sense
• Absorbing sensory input without processing it

By 11am, they're running on fumes.

### Slide 4: Masking Debt
**Masking:** The conscious and unconscious effort to suppress natural autistic responses to fit into neurotypical environments.

**Masking Debt:** What happens when six hours of pretending comes due.

Home isn't the problem.
Home is where they feel safe enough to stop pretending.

### Slide 5: The Sensory Bucket
Every sensory input, every social demand, every unexpected change adds drops to an invisible bucket.

School fills that bucket faster than almost anything else.

The bucket often doesn't overflow until your child feels safe.

That "final straw"? It's not the cause. It's the drop that made an already overflowing bucket spill.

### Slide 6: Why Home?
Your child melts down at home because **you're their safe person.**

With you, they don't have to mask.

Your home is the one place where they can stop pretending to be okay.

Teachers see the mask.
You see what's underneath.

### Slide 7: The After School Window
Here's the useful part: after school meltdowns are **predictable**.

You know when they'll happen.
The window is usually short: 15 minutes or less.

**Predictable means you can prepare.**

### Slide 8: How Sound Helps
Your child needs discharge after school.

A way to let accumulated stress flow out without adding anything new.

**Sound asks nothing:**
• No interaction required
• No motor control needed
• No cognitive processing
• Just something consistent to land on

Press play. That's it.

### Slide 9: What Works
**After school reset routine:**

1. Create a transition zone (quiet corner, low demands)
2. Have calming sounds ready BEFORE they walk in
3. Delay questions about school
4. Feed without asking
5. Allow movement or stillness (their choice)

Not prevention. Reset support.

### Slide 10: CTA
Your child spent six hours holding it together.

Now they're home.

Home is where they can finally let go.

3:47pm. The school door opens.

Your child walks to the car. Quiet. Fine. Maybe even smiling.

Fifteen minutes later, they're screaming on the kitchen floor.

You didn't say the wrong thing. The shoes that were fine this morning are suddenly unbearable. The snack you offered is offensive. And by the time you try to understand what's happening, they're too far gone to tell you.

Meanwhile, the teachers say they're fine at school. Quiet, even. Good.

So why do they only fall apart with you?

Here's what nobody tells parents: your child isn't saving their worst behaviour for home. They're not punishing you. They're not manipulating.

They've spent six hours holding themselves together. And you're watching what happens when they can't hold on any longer.

This is an after school meltdown. It's one of the most common patterns in autism.

Your child doesn't explode at home because home is the problem. They explode because home is where they finally feel safe enough to stop pretending.

Think about what a school day actually costs your child's brain:
• Six hours of fluorescent lighting
• Corridors that echo unpredictably
• A timetable that changes without warning
• Twenty-eight other children to navigate, read, and respond to
• Sitting still when every cell wants to move
• Processing instructions that come too fast
• Filtering sounds that neurotypical children don't even notice

This conscious and unconscious effort to "pass" has a name: **masking**.

And masking has a cost.

By 3:30pm, there's nothing left. The reserves are empty. The suppression can't hold.

When they walk through your door, into the one place where they don't have to pretend? Everything they've been holding floods out at once.

This isn't bad behaviour. It's the masking debt coming due.

Your child melts down at home because you're their safe person. With you, they don't have to mask. Your home is the one place in their world where they can stop pretending to be okay.

That doesn't make it easier. Doesn't make the screaming less exhausting.

But it changes what you're witnessing.

Your child isn't punishing you. They're trusting you with the parts of themselves they can't show anyone else.

What helps? Sound. Passive listening that asks nothing. Press play. The frequencies or ambient noise fill the space. Your child's nervous system has something consistent and predictable to land on.

They don't have to engage with it. Don't have to respond. Don't have to do anything.

They just have to receive it.

After six hours of holding it together, your child is home. Home is where they can finally let go.

**Teachers:** "They're fine at school. No issues."

**You:** *watching your child melt down every single day at 4pm*

Let's talk about the gap between what teachers see and what parents live with.

Your child isn't fine at school. They're **masking** at school.

Masking is the invisible labour autistic children do to appear neurotypical. It costs everything.

Here's what masking looks like for your child:
• Suppressing the urge to cover their ears when the hand dryer screams
• Forcing eye contact that feels physically uncomfortable
• Not moving their body the way it needs to move
• Hiding confusion when instructions don't make sense
• Absorbing sensory input that would overwhelm them if they stopped to feel it

They're running on fumes by 11am. And there are still five hours to go.

By 3:30pm, there's nothing left. The reserves are empty. The suppression can't hold.

And when they walk through your door, into the one place where they don't have to pretend? Everything they've been holding floods out at once.

This is why teachers genuinely believe your child is fine. What they observe is a child working desperately hard to appear fine. A child using every bit of their energy to mask, to fit in, to not stand out.

The child you see at home is closer to the real picture. More exhausted. More overwhelmed. More themselves.

This doesn't mean school is bad or wrong. It means school is hard in ways that aren't visible from the outside. And it means your child needs support that accounts for that invisible load.

The meltdown after school isn't random. It isn't misbehaviour.

It's the predictable result of masking all day in environments that weren't built for your child's brain.

After the school door closes and before the evening begins, there's a window. A moment where your child's nervous system is deciding whether to tip into meltdown or find its way back to regulation.

Sound can meet them in that window. Not with demands. Not with words. Not with questions or tasks or expectations.

Just with something predictable and safe that lets their brain land somewhere.

Because your child spent six hours holding it together.

Now they're home.

And home is where they can finally let go.
