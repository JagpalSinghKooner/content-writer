# Newsletter Snippet: After School Meltdowns

## Hook

3:47pm. Your child walks out of school—quiet, fine, maybe even smiling. Fifteen minutes later, they're screaming on the kitchen floor. The teachers say they're fine at school, so why do they only fall apart with you?

## Body

Here's what nobody tells parents: your child isn't saving their worst behaviour for home. They've spent six hours holding themselves together at school—suppressing natural responses, forcing uncomfortable eye contact, absorbing sensory overload without processing it. That conscious and unconscious effort to "pass" is called masking. And masking has a cost.

By the time your child walks through your door, there's nothing left. The reserves are empty. The suppression can't hold. Home isn't the problem—home is where they finally feel safe enough to stop pretending. That "final straw" that triggered the meltdown? It didn't cause it. It was just the drop that made an already overflowing bucket spill.

Your child melts down at home because you're their safe person. With you, they don't have to mask. What teachers see is the mask. What you see is what's underneath. You're not getting their worst—you're getting their most honest.

After school meltdowns are predictable, which means you can prepare. Create a transition zone where they can decompress without pressure. Have calming sounds ready before they walk in—passive listening that asks nothing. Delay questions about school. Feed them without asking what they want. Give them space to exist without masking.

## CTA

Sound can meet your child in that critical window between walking through the door and falling apart. Not with demands or words, just something predictable and safe that lets their brain land somewhere.
