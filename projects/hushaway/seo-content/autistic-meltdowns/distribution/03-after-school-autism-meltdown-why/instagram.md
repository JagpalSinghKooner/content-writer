# Instagram Content: After School Meltdowns

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
**3:47pm**

Fine leaving school.

**4:02pm**

Screaming on the kitchen floor.

Why?

### Slide 2: It's Not You
Your child isn't saving their worst behaviour for home.

They're not punishing you.

They've been holding themselves together for six hours.

You're watching what happens when they can't hold on any longer.

### Slide 3: Masking
**Masking** = suppressing natural autistic responses to fit into neurotypical environments.

Six hours of:
• Forced eye contact
• Suppressing movement
• Hiding confusion
• Absorbing sensory overload

**Cost:** Everything.

### Slide 4: The Debt
By 11am: Running on fumes
By 3:30pm: Nothing left
By 4pm: Masking debt comes due

Home isn't the problem.

Home is where they feel safe enough to stop pretending.

### Slide 5: Why Home?
Teachers see the mask.

You see what's underneath.

Your child melts down at home because **you're their safe person.**

With you, they don't have to pretend.

### Slide 6: The Sensory Bucket
Every sensory input, every social demand, every unexpected change = drops in an invisible bucket.

School fills that bucket **fast.**

That "final straw"? Not the cause. The drop that made an overflowing bucket spill.

### Slide 7: The Window
After school meltdowns are **predictable.**

You know when they'll happen.
Usually 15 minutes or less.

Predictable = you can prepare.

### Slide 8: What Helps
**After school reset:**

✓ Quiet transition zone
✓ Calming sounds ready
✓ No questions about school
✓ Food without asking
✓ Space to exist without masking

Not prevention. Support.

### Slide 9: Sound
After six hours on high alert, your child needs **discharge.**

Sound asks nothing.
Press play.
They just receive it.

No interaction.
No demands.
Just something safe to land on.

### Slide 10: CTA
Your child spent six hours holding it together.

Now they're home.

Home is where they can finally let go.

## Caption

3:47pm. Your child walks out of school. Fine. Maybe even smiling.

15 minutes later, they're screaming on the kitchen floor.

Let's talk about what's really happening.

Your child isn't saving their worst behaviour for home. They're not punishing you. They've spent six hours holding themselves together at school—forcing eye contact that hurts, suppressing the urge to move, hiding confusion, absorbing sensory overload. That effort has a name: **masking.**

And masking has a cost.

By the time your child walks through your door, there's nothing left. The reserves are empty. The suppression can't hold. Home isn't the problem. Home is where they finally feel safe enough to stop pretending. Everything they've been holding floods out at once.

This is masking debt.

Your child melts down at home because you're their safe person. With you, they don't have to mask. Teachers see the mask. You see what's underneath. You're not getting their worst—you're getting their most honest.

After school meltdowns are predictable. That means you can prepare. Create a transition zone where they can decompress without pressure. Have calming sounds ready before they walk in. Delay questions about school. Feed them without asking what they want. Give them space to exist without masking.

Sound helps because it asks nothing. Press play. The frequencies fill the space. Your child's nervous system has something consistent and predictable to land on. They don't have to engage. They just have to receive it.

Some days the debt is too heavy and the meltdown happens anyway. That's okay. You haven't failed. Some days the school day is simply too much.

After six hours of holding it together, your child is home. And home is where they can finally let go.

Masking = suppressing natural autistic responses to fit in. Forced eye contact. No movement. Hiding confusion. Absorbing sensory overload.

By 3:30pm? Nothing left.

Home isn't the problem. Home is where they feel safe enough to stop pretending.

Teachers see the mask. You see the truth.

After school meltdowns = masking debt coming due."
