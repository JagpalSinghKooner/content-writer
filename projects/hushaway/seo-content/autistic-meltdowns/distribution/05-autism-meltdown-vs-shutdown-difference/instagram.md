# Instagram Content: Meltdown vs Shutdown: The Quiet Crisis Your Child Might Be Hiding

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
**THE QUIET CRISIS**

Meltdowns get attention.
Shutdowns go unnoticed.

[Large bold text, high contrast - dark text on light background]

### Slide 2: The Scene
Your child comes home from school.

Goes straight to their room.
Closes the door.

You call after them. Nothing.

This isn't rudeness.
This is a shutdown.

### Slide 3: Two Alarm Systems
**MELTDOWN:**
Brain hits the alarm
→ Sirens blaring
→ Everyone hears

**SHUTDOWN:**
Brain hits OFF switch
→ Power cut
→ Nobody notices

### Slide 4: What Meltdowns Look Like
**Outward explosion**

✗ Crying
✗ Screaming
✗ Hitting
✗ Running

Impossible to ignore.
Demands attention.

### Slide 5: What Shutdowns Look Like
**Inward collapse**

✗ Silence
✗ Stillness
✗ Blank stares
✗ Non-verbal

Easy to miss.
Doesn't demand attention.

### Slide 6: Same Overwhelm
Both come from nervous system overload.

**MELTDOWN**
= Fight-or-flight

**SHUTDOWN**
= Freeze

Neither is a choice.

### Slide 7: Why We Miss Them
Child mid-meltdown:
Impossible to ignore

Child mid-shutdown:
Looks "fine"
• Quiet
• Compliant
• No trouble

But inside?
Drowning in silence.

### Slide 8: Recognition Signs
**PHYSICAL:**
Blank expression
Slumped posture
Very still

**COMMUNICATION:**
Non-verbal
Single words only
Delayed responses

Not rudeness.
Nervous system offline.

### Slide 9: How to Help
❌ Don't ask questions
❌ Don't force engagement
❌ Don't expect responses

✓ Reduce demands to zero
✓ Create safety
✓ Be present, not intrusive
✓ Wait

### Slide 10: CTA
The quiet child who "checks out" after school needs just as much support.

Different response.
Same overwhelm.

The crisis nobody talks about 👇

.
.

Your child comes home from school and goes straight to their room without a word. You call after them. Nothing. You knock. Still nothing.

Tired, you think. Or sulking.

Here's what you might be missing: this isn't rest. This is a shutdown.

When we talk about autism meltdowns, most people picture the dramatic version—the screaming, the kicking, the visible distress that makes strangers stare.

But there's another response to overwhelm that looks completely different. It's quiet. It's still. And because it doesn't demand attention the way a meltdown does, it often goes completely unrecognised.

Think of it as two different alarm systems. A meltdown is the brain hitting the alarm switch—sirens blaring, everyone can hear it. A shutdown is the brain hitting the off switch—complete power cut, nobody notices.

Both come from nervous system overload. The difference? How it comes out.

**Meltdown = outward explosion.** Energy bursts out. Crying, screaming, hitting. Loud. Visible. Impossible to ignore.

**Shutdown = inward collapse.** Energy disappears. Withdrawal, silence, stillness, blank stares. Quiet. Invisible. Easy to miss entirely.

A simple way to remember: meltdown is fight-or-flight. Shutdown is freeze.

The child who goes quiet and still after school isn't resting. They're overwhelmed beyond words. Their nervous system has gone offline to protect itself.

And because they're not making noise, nobody notices.

That's the quiet crisis. The one nobody talks about.

If you recognise your child in this, now you have a name for it. Shutdown. And more importantly, tools to help.

**How to help during a shutdown:**
→ Reduce demands to zero (no questions, no requests)
→ Create safety (dim lights, reduce noise)
→ Be present but not intrusive
→ Wait (shutdowns run their course, just like meltdowns)

Sometimes gentle sound helps. Not to add stimulation, but to signal safety. Quiet soundscapes or low frequencies give the nervous system something safe to land on without adding demands.

The child who goes silent after school needs just as much support as the child having visible meltdowns. Maybe more. Because nobody's noticing.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Sometimes that quiet moment is giving them permission to be quiet themselves.
