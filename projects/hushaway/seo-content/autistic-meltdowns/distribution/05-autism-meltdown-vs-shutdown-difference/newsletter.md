# Newsletter Snippet: Meltdown vs Shutdown: The Quiet Crisis Your Child Might Be Hiding

## Hook

Your child comes home from school and goes straight to their room without a word. You call after them. Nothing. You knock. Still nothing. Tired, you think. Or sulking. Here's what you might be missing: this isn't rest. This is a shutdown. And it's the crisis that nobody talks about.

## Body

When we talk about autism meltdowns, most people picture the dramatic version—the screaming, the kicking, the visible distress. But there's another response to overwhelm that looks completely different: it's quiet, it's still, and because it doesn't demand attention the way a meltdown does, it often goes completely unrecognised.

Think of it as two different alarm systems. A meltdown is the brain hitting the alarm switch—sirens blaring, everyone can hear it. A shutdown is the brain hitting the off switch—complete power cut, nobody notices until they look closely. Both come from nervous system overload. The difference? How the overwhelm comes out.

A meltdown is an outward explosion. Energy bursts out—you see crying, screaming, hitting, throwing. Loud. Visible. Impossible to ignore. A shutdown is an inward collapse. Energy disappears—you see withdrawal, silence, stillness, blank stares. Quiet. Invisible. Easy to miss entirely.

Here's where it gets complicated: a child who has meltdowns at home might have shutdowns at school. Why? Because the social pressure to "hold it together" makes the explosive response feel impossible. So instead of exploding outward, they implode inward. Same overwhelm. Different outlet.

This is why teachers might say "they're fine at school" whilst you're dealing with daily meltdowns at home. They're not fine. They're holding everything in. Then it all comes out when they finally feel safe.

## CTA

The child who goes silent after school needs just as much support as the child having visible meltdowns. Maybe more. Because nobody's noticing.

When we think about autism meltdowns, we picture the dramatic version—the screaming, the kicking, the visible distress. But there's another response to overwhelm that looks completely different.

It's quiet. It's still. And because it doesn't demand attention, it often goes completely unrecognised. Days of shutdowns can pass before anyone realises something is wrong.

Here's what you'll learn:

• The two alarm systems (meltdown vs shutdown)
• Why shutdowns get missed
• Recognition signs your child is having a shutdown
• How to help (and why asking questions backfires)
• How sound helps differently for shutdowns

The child who goes silent after school might need just as much support as the child having visible meltdowns. Maybe more. Because nobody's noticing.
