# Twitter/X Content: Meltdown vs Shutdown: The Quiet Crisis Your Child Might Be Hiding

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your autistic child comes home from school and goes straight to their room without a word.

Not tired. Not rude.

This is a shutdown.

And it's the crisis nobody talks about.

🧵 Thread on the difference that changes everything:

### Tweet 2
When we talk about autism meltdowns, everyone pictures the dramatic version:
• Screaming
• Kicking
• Visible distress

But there's another response to overwhelm that looks completely different.

Quiet. Still. Easy to miss entirely.

### Tweet 3
Think of it as two different alarm systems:

**Meltdown:**
Brain hits the alarm switch
→ Sirens blaring
→ Everyone can hear it

**Shutdown:**
Brain hits the off switch
→ Complete power cut
→ Nobody notices until they look closely

### Tweet 4
Both come from the same place: nervous system overload.

The difference? How the overwhelm comes out.

**Meltdown = outward explosion**
Energy bursts out. Crying, screaming, hitting. Impossible to ignore.

**Shutdown = inward collapse**
Energy disappears. Silence, stillness, withdrawal.

### Tweet 5
A simple way to remember:

Meltdown = fight-or-flight

Shutdown = freeze

Both are involuntary. Neither is a choice.

Your child isn't having a shutdown to punish you with silence. Their nervous system is protecting itself.

### Tweet 6
Why shutdowns get missed:

A child mid-meltdown? Impossible to ignore.

A child mid-shutdown? Looks "fine."
• Quiet
• Compliant
• No trouble

But inside? They're drowning in silence.

This is why days of shutdowns can pass before anyone realises something is wrong.

### Tweet 7
Signs your child is having a shutdown:

**Physical:**
• Very still or moving in slow motion
• Slumped posture
• Blank expression
• Curling up, hiding

**Communication:**
• Non-verbal or single words only
• Delayed responses
• No eye contact

**Behaviour:**
• Withdrawn, checked out

### Tweet 8
Here's where it gets complicated:

A child who has meltdowns at home might have shutdowns at school.

Why? Social pressure to "hold it together" makes the explosive response feel impossible.

So instead of exploding outward, they implode inward.

Same overwhelm. Different outlet.

### Tweet 9
How to help during a shutdown:

❌ Don't ask questions (adds demands)
❌ Don't force engagement
❌ Don't expect responses

✓ Reduce demands to zero
✓ Create safety (dim lights, quiet)
✓ Be present, not intrusive
✓ Wait

Questions = demands = more overwhelm.

### Tweet 10
Your instinct when your child goes quiet is to ask: "What's wrong? Did something happen? Are you okay?"

During a shutdown, this backfires completely.

Every "are you okay?" adds more weight to an already overloaded system.

Let them exist without having to respond.

### Tweet 11
Sometimes gentle sound helps during shutdowns.

Not to add stimulation, but to signal safety.

Very quiet soundscapes or low frequencies give the nervous system something safe to land on without adding demands.

No interaction required. Just background calm.

### Tweet 12
What comes after a shutdown:

Just like meltdown recovery, there's a fragile period after. Sometimes longer.

They might be:
• Exhausted for hours
• Disoriented
• Emotionally sensitive
• Needing reassurance

Give them time. Keep demands low.

### Tweet 13
The quiet crisis:

Meltdowns get attention. Shutdowns get overlooked.

But that child who goes silent after school? The one who seems "fine" because they're not causing trouble?

They might need just as much support as the child having visible meltdowns.

Maybe more.

### Tweet 14
TL;DR:

• Shutdowns = inward collapse (freeze response)
• Meltdowns = outward explosion (fight-or-flight)
• Both from nervous system overload
• Shutdowns are easy to miss
• Reduce demands, create safety, wait
• The quiet child needs support too

### Tweet 15 (Wrap)
If you recognise your child in this thread, now you have a name for it.

Shutdown.

And more importantly, tools to help.

Not lectures. Not consequences. Not questions.

Just space. Safety. Time.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Meltdown = fight-or-flight

Shutdown = freeze

Both are autism responses to overwhelm.

One is loud and visible. The other is quiet and easy to miss.

But the child who goes silent after school needs just as much support as the child who's screaming.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

Shutdowns are harder to support than meltdowns.

Why? Because everyone notices a meltdown. Nobody notices a shutdown until it's been happening for days.

The quiet crisis is the one nobody talks about.

### Tweet C (Recognition)
5 signs your child is having a shutdown (not just "tired"):

• Blank expression (lights on, nobody home)
• Non-verbal or single words only
• Slumped posture, very still
• Not responding to their name
• Withdrawing from things they normally enjoy

Context matters. Trust what you're seeing.

### Tweet D (Parent Mistake)
Common mistake during shutdowns:

Asking "What's wrong? Did something happen? Are you okay?"

Every question is a demand. Demands require processing. Your child can't process right now.

What helps: Reduce demands to zero. Be present without expecting responses. Wait.

### Tweet E (Comparison)
A child who has meltdowns at home might have shutdowns at school.

Social pressure to "hold it together" makes the explosive response feel impossible.

So instead of exploding outward, they implode inward.

Same overwhelm. Different outlet.

Teachers: "They're fine at school."
Reality: They're holding everything in.
