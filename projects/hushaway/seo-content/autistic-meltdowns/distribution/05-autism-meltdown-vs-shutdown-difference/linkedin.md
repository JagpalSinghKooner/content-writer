# LinkedIn Content: Meltdown vs Shutdown: The Quiet Crisis Your Child Might Be Hiding

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
**The crisis nobody talks about**

Meltdowns get attention.
Shutdowns go unnoticed.

Swipe → to learn the difference that changes everything

### Slide 2: The Quiet Crisis
When your child comes home from school and goes straight to their room without a word...

Not rude. Not tired. Not sulking.

This is a shutdown.

And it's the autism response most parents never hear about.

### Slide 3: Two Alarm Systems
**Meltdown:**
The brain hits the alarm switch
→ Sirens blaring
→ Everyone can hear it

**Shutdown:**
The brain hits the off switch
→ Complete power cut
→ Nobody notices

### Slide 4: What Meltdowns Look Like
**Outward explosion**

Energy bursts out:
• Crying
• Screaming
• Hitting
• Running

Impossible to miss.
Demands attention.

### Slide 5: What Shutdowns Look Like
**Inward collapse**

Energy disappears:
• Silence
• Stillness
• Blank stares
• Non-verbal

Easy to miss entirely.
Doesn't demand attention.

### Slide 6: Same Cause, Different Response
Both come from nervous system overload.

**Meltdown = Fight-or-flight**
The overwhelm explodes outward

**Shutdown = Freeze**
The overwhelm collapses inward

Neither is a choice.

### Slide 7: Why Shutdowns Get Missed
A child mid-meltdown? Impossible to ignore.

A child mid-shutdown? Looks "fine."
• Quiet
• Compliant
• No trouble

But inside? They're drowning in silence.

### Slide 8: Recognition Signs
**Physical:**
Blank expression, slumped posture, very still

**Communication:**
Non-verbal or single words only

**Behaviour:**
Withdrawn, checked out, unresponsive

Not rudeness. Nervous system offline.

### Slide 9: How to Help
❌ Don't ask questions (adds demands)
❌ Don't force engagement
❌ Don't expect responses

✓ Reduce demands to zero
✓ Create safety (dim lights, quiet)
✓ Be present, not intrusive
✓ Wait

### Slide 10: CTA
The quiet child who "checks out" after school needs just as much support as the child having visible meltdowns.

Different response. Same overwhelm.

Your child comes home from school. Walks past you without a word. Goes straight to their room. Closes the door.

You call after them. Nothing.

You knock. "How was your day?" Still nothing.

You peek in. They're sitting on the bed, staring at the wall.

Tired, you think. Or sulking. Had a rough day.

Here's what you might be missing: this isn't rest. This is a shutdown.

When we talk about autism meltdowns, most people picture the dramatic version. The screaming. The kicking. The visible distress.

But there's another response to overwhelm that looks completely different.

It's quiet. It's still. And because it doesn't demand attention the way a meltdown does, it often goes completely unrecognised.

Think of it as two different alarm systems:
→ A meltdown is the brain hitting the alarm switch (sirens blaring)
→ A shutdown is the brain hitting the off switch (complete power cut)

Both come from nervous system overload. The difference? How the overwhelm comes out.

**Meltdown = outward explosion.** Energy bursts. You see crying, screaming, hitting, throwing. Loud. Visible. Impossible to ignore.

**Shutdown = inward collapse.** Energy disappears. You see withdrawal, silence, stillness, blank stares. Quiet. Invisible. Easy to miss entirely.

A simple way to remember: meltdown is fight-or-flight. Shutdown is freeze.

The child who goes quiet and still after school isn't resting. They're overwhelmed beyond words. Their nervous system has gone offline to protect itself from further input.

And because they're not making noise, nobody notices.

That's the quiet crisis. The one nobody talks about.

If you recognise your child in this, now you have a name for it. And more importantly, tools to help.

**Most people think autistic children either have meltdowns or they don't.**

Here's what they're missing: shutdowns.

A child who has meltdowns at home might have shutdowns at school. Why? Because the social pressure to "hold it together" makes the explosive response feel impossible.

So instead of exploding outward, they implode inward.

Same overwhelm. Different outlet.

This is why teachers might say "they're fine at school" whilst you're dealing with daily meltdowns at home. They're not fine. They're holding everything in. Then it all comes out when they finally feel safe.

The reverse can happen too: shutdown at home, meltdown at school. Or both in different situations.

**Signs your child is having a shutdown:**

Physical:
• Becoming very still or moving in slow motion
• Slumped posture, like the strings have been cut
• Blank or glazed expression (lights on, nobody home)
• Not making eye contact

Communication:
• Reduced speech or becoming completely non-verbal
• Single-word answers. Or no answers at all.
• Delayed responses, as if they didn't hear you (they heard you, they just can't process)

Behaviour:
• Withdrawing from people and activities they normally enjoy
• Stopping mid-task and not resuming
• Appearing "checked out" or dissociated
• Not responding to their name

Here's the tricky part: some of these signs overlap with ordinary tiredness. Context matters.

Did something overwhelming happen before this? Has the day been full of demands?

You know your child better than anyone. Trust what you're seeing.

**How to help during a shutdown:**

Your instinct is to ask questions. "What's wrong? Did something happen?"

During a shutdown, this backfires completely. Questions are demands. They require processing. And your child can't process right now.

What actually helps:
→ Reduce demands to zero (no questions, no requests)
→ Create safety (dim lights, reduce noise)
→ Be present but not intrusive
→ Wait (shutdowns run their course, just like meltdowns)

Sometimes gentle sound helps. Not to add stimulation, but to signal safety. Quiet soundscapes or low frequencies give the nervous system something safe to land on without adding demands.

The child who goes silent after school needs just as much support as the child having visible meltdowns.

Maybe more. Because nobody's noticing.

"They just need space."
"They're tired."
"They're being rude."

If your autistic child goes silent and still after overwhelming situations, you're probably hearing one of these explanations.

Here's what it actually is: a shutdown.

And it's not rudeness. It's not laziness. It's not manipulation.

It's a nervous system that's gone offline.

**The difference between needing space and having a shutdown:**

When a child needs space, they can still respond if needed. They might be slower, quieter, less engaged. But they're still present.

When a child is having a shutdown, they can't respond. Not won't. Can't. The capacity simply isn't there.

It's like their brain has disconnected from their body to protect itself from further input.

This is why the National Autistic Society emphasises that shutdowns need just as much understanding and support as meltdowns. The external presentation is different. The internal experience can be just as intense.

**What comes after a shutdown:**

Just like meltdown recovery, there's a period after a shutdown where your child is fragile. Sometimes more fragile than after a meltdown, because shutdowns can last longer and drain more deeply.

They might be:
• Exhausted for hours
• Disoriented about how much time passed
• Emotionally sensitive to small things
• Needing extra reassurance
• Hungry or thirsty (body signals were suppressed)

Give them time. Keep demands low for longer than you think necessary.

And resist the urge to ask too many questions about what happened. If they want to talk about it, they will.

Sometimes the kindest thing you can say is nothing at all.

**The quiet crisis:**

Meltdowns get the attention. Shutdowns get overlooked.

But that child who goes silent after school? The one who seems "fine" because they're not causing trouble? They might need just as much support as the child having a visible meltdown.

Maybe more. Because nobody's noticing.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Sometimes that quiet moment is giving them permission to be quiet themselves.
