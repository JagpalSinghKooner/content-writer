# Pillar Brief: Bedtime Routines for Neurodivergent Children

## 1. Strategic Context

**Pillar:** Bedtime Routines (Neurodivergent-Specific)
**Priority:** Medium
**Why now:** 1,200+ monthly UK searches for ND bedtime routines, moderate competition, clear product-market fit. All competitors mention sound in passing; NONE position it as primary tool.
**Proprietary advantage:** HushAway® is the ONLY UK resource positioning sound AS THE CORE element of bedtime routines, not an afterthought. Every competitor says "try calming music" — we say "here's exactly what to play, when, and why it works."

## 4. Content Plan

### Article 1: Why Bedtime is Harder for Neurodivergent Children (PRIORITY: Do First)
- **Target keyword:** neurodivergent bedtime struggles, why won't my neurodivergent child sleep
- **Secondary keywords:** adhd child won't sleep, autistic child bedtime battles, neurodivergent sleep problems
- **Content type:** Explainer / Foundation
- **Word count:** 2,000-2,500
- **Angle opportunity:** Validate that bedtime struggles are neurological, not behavioural. Racing ADHD brain, autistic transition anxiety, sensory overwhelm—these aren't discipline problems. Set up sound as solution in later articles.

### Article 2: Sound-Based Bedtime Routine for ND Children (PRIORITY: Do Second)
- **Target keyword:** bedtime sounds routine, sounds help child sleep
- **Secondary keywords:** calming sounds bedtime, sleep sounds for neurodivergent children, what sounds help child sleep
- **Content type:** How-To / Product Bridge (Conversion Driver)
- **Word count:** 2,200-2,800
- **Angle opportunity:** **THE GAP-FILLER.** Every competitor mentions sound in passing; no one positions it as PRIMARY or explains WHAT to play WHEN. This article is HushAway's unique value: "Sound isn't background—it's the missing core element. Here's exactly what to play at each stage of your routine."

### Article 3: Visual Bedtime Routine for Neurodivergent Children
- **Target keyword:** visual bedtime routine, picture bedtime schedule
- **Secondary keywords:** bedtime visual supports neurodivergent, now and next bedtime, bedtime routine chart
- **Content type:** How-To / Tool
- **Word count:** 1,800-2,300
- **Angle opportunity:** Fill the template gap. Research shows every source recommends visual supports but few provide actual templates or examples. Combine visual schedules WITH sound cues (e.g., "Picture shows story time → Sound plays: Night Time Sky").

### Article 4: ADHD Bedtime Routine That Actually Works
- **Target keyword:** adhd bedtime routine, adhd child won't go to bed
- **Secondary keywords:** adhd racing thoughts bedtime, revenge bedtime procrastination child, adhd brain won't turn off
- **Content type:** How-To / Condition-Specific
- **Word count:** 2,200-2,700
- **Angle opportunity:** ADHD brain requires different approach than autism. Address: racing thoughts (sound gives the brain something to land on), revenge bedtime procrastination (ADHD Centre mentions this but no solutions), transition difficulty (ADHD brain takes months to establish routine).

### Article 5: Autism Bedtime Routine: Predictability and Calm
- **Target keyword:** autism bedtime routine, autistic child bedtime anxiety
- **Secondary keywords:** autism sleep routine, autism transition bedtime, autistic child scared at bedtime
- **Content type:** How-To / Condition-Specific
- **Word count:** 2,200-2,700
- **Angle opportunity:** Predictability as anxiety reducer. Autistic children need to know EXACTLY what happens next. Position sound as predictable, consistent input that signals "this is sleep time now." Address gradual retreat method with sound as parent-presence replacement.

### Article 6: Bedtime Anxiety in Children: Sound as the Calm Answer
- **Target keyword:** bedtime anxiety child, child scared at bedtime
- **Secondary keywords:** fear of dark autism, separation anxiety bedtime, child won't sleep alone
- **Content type:** How-To / Problem-Solution
- **Word count:** 2,000-2,500
- **Angle opportunity:** Sound provides PRESENCE without parent being physically there. When parent leaves the room, sound stays. Address: fear of dark (sound as companion), separation anxiety (gradual retreat with sound remaining), racing thoughts (sound fills the quiet).

### Pillar Article 7: Complete Guide to Bedtime Routines for Neurodivergent Children (PUBLISH LAST)
- **Target keyword:** neurodivergent bedtime routine, bedtime routine neurodivergent child uk
- **Secondary keywords:** autism adhd bedtime routine, neurodivergent sleep strategies, bedtime routine neurodivergent children uk
- **Content type:** Comprehensive Guide (Pillar)
- **Word count:** 4,000-5,000
- **Links to:** Articles 1-6
- **Angle opportunity:** THE authoritative UK resource. Comprehensive framework: structure + sound + visuals + condition-specific guidance. Position HushAway® as THE solution that integrates all elements (routine structure competitors have + sound guidance they're missing).

## 5. Angle Opportunities

Based on competitor gaps, these angles are available:

1. **"Sound as THE Core Element"** — Every competitor mentions sound in passing ("try calming music"). NO ONE positions sound as a PRIMARY tool deserving equal weight to visual supports or weighted blankets. HushAway fills this by explaining WHAT sounds to play WHEN and WHY passive listening works.

2. **"The WHAT Gap"** — All competitors: "Try calming music." None say WHAT music, WHAT sounds, WHICH types for sleep onset vs. night waking, HOW to choose. HushAway provides the specificity parents desperately need.

3. **"Sound + Structure Integration"** — Competitors give routine structure (bath → pajamas → story → lights out) OR mention sound separately. NO ONE integrates sound INTO each routine step. HushAway positions sound as woven through the entire routine, not just "play music at bedtime."

4. **"Zero-Effort for Exhausted Parents"** — Research emphasises parent exhaustion but no competitor frames sound as the EASIEST tool (no setup, no decisions, just press play). HushAway's passive listening angle directly addresses parent burnout.

5. **"Racing Brain Solution"** — ADHD Centre mentions "quietness makes ADHD brain race" but offers NO auditory solution. Massive gap. HushAway explains WHY sound gives the racing brain something to land on.

**Recommended starting angle:** "Sound as THE Core Element" — the umbrella positioning that differentiates HushAway from ALL competitors. Extend into specificity (WHAT sounds), integration (WHEN in routine), and parent exhaustion (zero-effort) in supporting articles.

| Links BETWEEN supporting articles | During writing if target exists, otherwise use placeholder |
| Links FROM pillar guide | During pillar guide writing (all supporting articles exist) |

**Placeholder convention:** When an article needs to link to content that doesn't exist yet:
```html
<!-- LINK NEEDED: [slug] when published -->

## 7. Publishing Order

| Order | Article | Depends On | Notes |
|-------|---------|------------|-------|

## 8. Key Messaging

**Primary Message:**
> Bedtime routines for neurodivergent children need structure (visual supports, consistency) AND sound. Every expert tells you the structure. We're the only ones telling you WHAT sounds to play, WHEN, and WHY they work.

**Supporting Messages:**
- **For ADHD:** Racing brain needs something to land on. Sound gives it that anchor.
- **For Autism:** Predictability reduces anxiety. Sound is predictable, sensory-safe input that signals "sleep time."
- **For Parents:** Passive listening = zero effort. Just press play. No choices, no setup, no decisions.
- **For Anxiety:** Sound stays when you leave the room. It's presence without parent being there.

**Competitor Differentiation:**
- National Autistic Society: Clinical guidance, sound in passing → HushAway: Parent-friendly, sound as core
- NHS: Environmental modifications, no audio specifics → HushAway: WHAT sounds, WHEN to use them
- The Sleep Charity: Generic bedtime advice → HushAway: Neurodivergent-first, sound-first
- ADHD Centre: Identifies problem (racing brain), no solution → HushAway: Sound IS the solution
- Beyond Autism: Visual supports only → HushAway: Visual + auditory integration

**CTA Strategy:**
- Primary CTA: The Open Sanctuary (try sounds tonight)
- Soft CTAs: "Explore Night Time Stories," "Try Frequencies for Sleep"
- Product bridge: Article 02 (sound routine) drives directly to The Open Sanctuary exploration
