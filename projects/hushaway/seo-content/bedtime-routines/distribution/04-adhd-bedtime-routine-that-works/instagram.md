# Instagram Content: ADHD Bedtime Routine That Actually Works

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
Your ADHD child won't go to bed.

You've tried everything.

Nothing works.

Here's why →

### Slide 2: The Problem
"Create a calm environment"

Standard advice.

For an ADHD brain?
It makes things WORSE.

Calm = empty
Empty = thoughts rush in

### Slide 3: The Racing Brain
Picture a radio scanning for a station.

That's your child's brain at bedtime.

Nothing to tune into.

So it creates its own noise.

### Slide 4: Not Defiance
Your child isn't fighting you.

They're fighting the silence that's coming.

The brain resists losing stimulation.

That's neurology, not behaviour.

### Slide 5: Revenge Bedtime Procrastination
"One more thing."
"I need water."
"Can I tell you something?"

This isn't manipulation.

It's the brain's last stand against losing control.

### Slide 6: The Missing Element
Sound gives the racing brain somewhere to land.

Not music.
Not stories.

Passive sound.
Ambient.
Consistent.

### Slide 7: The 4-Stage Routine
1. Long wind-down (90-120 mins)
2. Physical tasks with sound
3. In-bedroom settling
4. Sound all night

Each stage supports the brain.

### Slide 8: The Timeline
Week 2: Small improvements
Week 4: Feels familiar
Week 6: Automatic settling

ADHD brains need 4-6 weeks.

That's normal.

### Slide 9: The Reality
Up to 75% of children with ADHD struggle with sleep.

Three in four.

You're not alone.
You're not failing.

### Slide 10: CTA
Save this for tonight's bedtime 📌

## Caption

Your ADHD child won't go to bed. You've tried everything. Earlier bedtimes. Screen-free evenings. Calm environments. Nothing sticks.

.
.
.

Here's what the advice misses: an ADHD brain at bedtime isn't being defiant. It's doing exactly what ADHD brains do. Racing. Seeking. Filling silence because silence feels unbearable.

Picture your child's brain like a radio scanning for a station. There's nothing to tune into. So it creates its own noise. Worries. Questions. Stories. Anything to fill the void.

Generic "wind-down time" doesn't work because there's nothing for the brain to land on. The silence you're creating isn't calm for them. It's a vacuum their thoughts rush to fill.

Building an ADHD bedtime routine that actually works means understanding this: that racing brain needs something to land on. Sound gives it an anchor.

Not music with melodies their brain will try to follow. Not podcasts with stories. Passive sound. Ambient. Consistent. Predictable. Sound that fills the silence without demanding anything.

According to the Sleep Foundation, up to 75% of children with ADHD report sleep problems. Three in four. If bedtime is a battle in your house, you're not alone. And you're not failing.

An effective ADHD bedtime routine isn't about stricter rules or more discipline. You don't need to be more consistent. You need to give your child's brain what it actually needs at each stage.

The honest timeline? Expect four to six weeks of consistent practice. ADHD brains need more repetition to build automatic associations. That's the neurology, not your parenting.

But here's what happens when you stick with it: Week 2 brings small improvements. Week 4, the routine starts feeling familiar. Week 6, automatic settling becomes possible. Not every night. But regularly.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. For ADHD children, that quiet moment starts when their racing brain finally has somewhere to settle.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your ADHD child won't go to bed. You've tried everything. Here's why nothing's worked."

**[3-22 seconds: VALUE]**
"Standard advice says create a calm environment. But for an ADHD brain, calm means empty. Empty means the thoughts rush in.

Picture a radio scanning for a station. That's your child's brain at bedtime. Nothing to tune into. So it creates its own noise.

The fix? Sound. Not music. Not stories. Passive, ambient sound that gives the racing brain something to land on.

An anchor instead of silence."

## Visual Notes

**Carousel Design:**
- Soft, calming colours (muted blues, gentle purples, warm neutrals)
- High contrast text for readability
- Sans-serif font, large and bold
- Minimal design with breathing room
- Slide 2 could use a visual metaphor (empty room vs sound waves)
- Slide 3 could show radio dial visual
- Slide 7 could use simple icons for each stage

**Reel B-roll Suggestions:**
- Close-up of child in bed, eyes open, clearly unable to settle
- Parent sitting on landing, exhausted
- Visual of sound waves filling empty space
- Close-up of device playing calming audio
- Child peacefully settling with gentle sound playing
- Morning scene: rested child, calm parent
