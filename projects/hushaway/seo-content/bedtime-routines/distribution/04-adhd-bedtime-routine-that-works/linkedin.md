# LinkedIn Content: ADHD Bedtime Routine That Actually Works

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
Your ADHD child won't go to bed.

You've tried everything.

Swipe → to learn why nothing's worked (and what actually does)

### Slide 2: The Problem
Generic "calm environment" advice makes it WORSE.

For an ADHD brain, calm = empty.

Empty = vacuum the thoughts rush to fill.

### Slide 3: The Racing Brain
Picture a radio scanning for a station.

That's your child's brain at bedtime.

In the quiet, there's nothing to tune into.

So it creates its own noise.

### Slide 4: Revenge Bedtime Procrastination
"One more thing."
"I need to tell you something."
"Can I have water?"

This isn't manipulation.

It's the brain's last stand against losing stimulation.

### Slide 5: The Missing Element
Sound gives the racing brain something to land on.

Not music. Not stories.

Passive sound. Ambient. Consistent.

An anchor instead of silence.

### Slide 6: The 4-Stage Routine
1. Long wind-down (90-120 mins)
2. Physical tasks with sound continuity
3. In-bedroom settling with focused sound
4. Sound stays on all night

### Slide 7: The Timeline
Week 2: Small improvements
Week 4: Routine feels familiar
Week 6: Automatic settling starts

ADHD brains take longer.
That's neurology, not your parenting.

### Slide 8: Summary
Quick recap:

1. Calm environments fail ADHD brains
2. Racing thoughts need anchors
3. Sound fills silence without demands
4. Expect 4-6 weeks of consistency
5. Small improvements compound

### Slide 9: CTA

It's 9:47pm. You put your child to bed at 7:30.

They've been out of bed seventeen times.

For water. For the loo. To tell you something urgent about penguins.

If your ADHD child won't go to bed, you've heard all the advice. Earlier bedtimes. Screen-free evenings. Consistent routines. Calm environments.

You've tried it all. Nothing sticks.

Here's what the advice misses:

An ADHD brain at bedtime isn't being defiant. It's doing exactly what ADHD brains do. Racing. Seeking. Filling silence with thoughts because silence feels unbearable.

Picture your child's brain like a radio scanning for a station. There's nothing to tune into. So it creates its own noise. Worries. Questions. Stories. Plans. Anything to fill the void.

Generic "wind-down time" doesn't work because there's nothing for the brain to land on. The silence you're creating isn't calm for them. It's a vacuum their thoughts rush to fill.

Building an ADHD bedtime routine that actually works means understanding this:

That racing brain needs something to land on. Sound gives it an anchor.

Not music with melodies their brain will try to follow. Not podcasts with stories. Not audiobooks that keep them engaged.

Passive sound. Ambient. Consistent. Predictable.

Sound that fills the silence without demanding anything. Sound that gives the wandering brain a soft place to rest.

According to the Sleep Foundation, up to 75% of children with ADHD report sleep problems. Three in four. The most common issue? Taking too long to fall asleep.

It happens because a quiet bedroom feels to an ADHD brain like a room with no oxygen. Nothing to hold onto. Nothing to anchor the spinning.

So the brain manufactures its own stimulation. Thoughts. Worries. Questions. The internal noise rises to fill the external silence.

Your child isn't resisting sleep. They're drowning in the thoughts that flood a quiet room, and they don't know how to stop.

An effective ADHD bedtime routine isn't about stricter rules or more discipline. You don't need to be more consistent.

You need to give your child's brain what it actually needs at each stage.

The honest timeline? Expect four to six weeks of consistent practice. ADHD brains need more repetition to build automatic associations. That's the neurology, not your parenting.

But here's what happens when you stick with it:

After two weeks: Small improvements. Less resistance. Slightly faster settling.

After four weeks: The routine starts feeling familiar. Your child's body begins responding before their mind catches up.

After six weeks: Automatic settling becomes possible. Not every night. But regularly.

The routine becomes the default rather than a nightly battle.

What can you do tonight?

Start playing quiet ambient sound in your home one hour before bed begins. When physical wind-down starts, keep the sound going. When your child gets into bed, shift to focused sound. Frequencies work well for the ADHD brain that won't turn off.

Leave the sound playing through the night.

Tomorrow, do exactly the same thing. And the next night. And the night after that.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

For ADHD children, that quiet moment starts when their racing brain finally has somewhere to settle.

Revenge bedtime procrastination.

If you parent an ADHD child, you know exactly what this looks like.

Bedtime is announced. Suddenly your child urgently needs to:
→ Finish one more thing
→ Tell you something that cannot wait
→ Find a toy they haven't touched in months
→ Ask about something from three weeks ago
→ Get one more drink
→ Reorganise their bookshelf at 9pm

This isn't manipulation. It's not poor boundaries.

It's something researchers call "revenge bedtime procrastination," and it's especially common in children with ADHD.

Think about your child's day:

School demands focus their brain fights to maintain. Rules require sitting still when their body wants to move. Social situations require monitoring impulses they barely notice until after they've acted on them.

Everything requires effort that feels ten times harder than it should.

Then bedtime arrives. The child finally has control. Their brain finally has freedom.

And at an unconscious level, some part of them resists giving that up by going unconscious.

The procrastination isn't revenge against you. It's the brain's last stand against losing the one time of day that feels undemanding.

How to address it:

1. Build in acceptable stalling
If your child needs to get out of bed five times, build those five things into the routine. Water bottle by the bed. Bathroom trip scheduled. Tomorrow's questions answered during wind-down.

You're not giving in to bad behaviour. You're anticipating legitimate needs.

2. Give them control within structure
They choose which sounds to play from two or three options. They decide the order of teeth and pyjamas. They pick which book for the brief story.

The routine happens. But within it, they have choices.

3. The after-bedtime promise
For older children: anything that feels urgent at bedtime gets written down and discussed tomorrow morning.

Not dismissed. Genuinely addressed, at breakfast.

Their thoughts matter. They just don't need to happen at 10pm.

The revenge in revenge bedtime procrastination is about control. Give your ADHD child age-appropriate control over their routine, and the resistance reduces naturally.

Have you seen this pattern in your household? What helps your child settle?

"Just create a calm environment."

Standard bedtime advice for all children. And for ADHD children, it often makes things worse.

Here's why:

Calm, for a neurotypical brain, means settling.

For an ADHD brain, calm means empty. Nothing to focus on. Nothing to anchor thoughts.

Calm becomes the vacuum that thoughts rush to fill.

When you remove all stimulation, you're not creating peace. You're creating a space where the ADHD brain generates its own chaos.

I've worked with hundreds of parents who tried the standard advice:
→ Dim lights
→ Quiet house
→ No screens
→ Consistent routine

All good advice. But missing one critical element.

The ADHD brain at bedtime isn't being difficult. It's doing exactly what ADHD brains do. Seeking stimulation. Racing. Filling silence because silence feels unbearable.

Picture a fidgeter. Their hands search for something to hold. When you give them a fidget tool, the searching stops. The hands have something.

Sound does the same thing for a racing mind. It stops searching because it has something to tune into.

Not music with melodies the brain tries to follow. Not podcasts with stories that keep them engaged. Not audiobooks that make them want to know what happens next.

Passive sound. Ambient. Consistent. Predictable.

Sound that fills the silence without demanding anything. Sound that gives the wandering brain a soft place to rest.

We built The Open Sanctuary for moments exactly like this. Sounds designed specifically for neurodivergent children. Frequencies. Ambient soundscapes. Gentle, unchanging audio that gives the wandering mind somewhere to rest.

No instructions to follow. No engagement required from your already exhausted child.

Just press play and let their brain find something to land on.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.
