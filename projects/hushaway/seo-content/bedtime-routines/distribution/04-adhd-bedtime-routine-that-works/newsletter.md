# Newsletter Snippet: ADHD Bedtime Routine That Actually Works

## Hook

It's 9:47pm. You put your child to bed at 7:30. They've been out of bed seventeen times. For water. For the loo. To tell you something urgent about penguins.

## Body

If your ADHD child won't go to bed, you've heard all the advice. Earlier bedtimes. Screen-free evenings. Consistent routines. Calm environments. You've tried it all. Nothing sticks.

Here's what the advice misses: an ADHD brain at bedtime isn't being defiant. It's doing exactly what ADHD brains do. Racing. Seeking. Filling silence with thoughts because silence feels unbearable. Picture your child's brain like a radio scanning for a station. There's nothing to tune into. So it creates its own noise.

Generic "wind-down time" doesn't work because there's nothing for the brain to land on. The silence you're creating isn't calm for them. It's a vacuum their thoughts rush to fill. Building an ADHD bedtime routine that actually works means understanding this one thing: that racing brain needs something to land on. Sound gives it an anchor.

We've written a complete guide to understanding why the ADHD brain won't switch off at night, what revenge bedtime procrastination actually is (and how to address it), and how to build a 4-stage routine that gives your child's brain what it needs at each stage. Including the honest timeline: expect four to six weeks of consistent practice. ADHD brains take longer to form habits. That's neurology, not your parenting.
