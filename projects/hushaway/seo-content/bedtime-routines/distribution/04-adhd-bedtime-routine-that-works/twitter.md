# Twitter/X Content: ADHD Bedtime Routine That Actually Works

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your ADHD child won't go to bed.

You've tried everything.

Here's why nothing's worked (and what actually does)

🧵 Thread:

### Tweet 2
1. THE PROBLEM

"Create a calm environment" is standard advice.

For an ADHD brain, calm = empty.

Empty = vacuum the thoughts rush to fill.

You're not creating peace. You're creating chaos.

### Tweet 3
2. THE RACING BRAIN

Picture a radio scanning for a station.

That's your child's brain at bedtime. Scanning. Scanning. Scanning.

There's nothing to tune into. So it creates its own noise.

### Tweet 4
3. REVENGE BEDTIME PROCRASTINATION

"One more thing."
"I need water."
"Can I tell you something?"

This isn't manipulation.

It's the brain's last stand against losing stimulation.

### Tweet 5
4. THE MISSING ELEMENT

Sound gives the racing brain something to land on.

Not music. Not stories.

Passive sound. Ambient. Consistent.

An anchor instead of silence.

### Tweet 6
5. THE 4-STAGE ROUTINE

• Long wind-down (90-120 mins)
• Physical tasks with sound continuity
• In-bedroom settling with focused sound
• Sound stays on all night

Each stage gives the brain what it needs.

### Tweet 7
6. WHAT TO EXPECT

Week 2: Small improvements
Week 4: Routine feels familiar
Week 6: Automatic settling starts

ADHD brains take 4-6 weeks to form habits.

That's neurology, not your parenting.

7. WHY SOUND WORKS

Think of a fidgeter. Hands search for something to hold. Give them a fidget tool, the searching stops.

Sound does the same for a racing mind.

It stops searching because it has something to tune into.

### Tweet 9
8. THE REALITY

According to the Sleep Foundation, up to 75% of children with ADHD report sleep problems.

Three in four.

If you're dealing with this, you're not alone. And you're not failing.

### Tweet 10 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Calm environments fail ADHD brains
• Racing thoughts need anchors, not silence
• Sound fills the void without demands
• Expect 4-6 weeks of consistency
• Small improvements compound

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
ADHD bedtime truth:

Your child isn't fighting you.

They're fighting the silence that's coming.

The brain resists the loss of stimulation. That's not defiance. That's neurology.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

"Calm bedtime environment" advice makes ADHD bedtimes WORSE.

Calm = empty for an ADHD brain.
Empty = vacuum the thoughts rush to fill.

You need sound, not silence.

### Tweet C (List)
5 signs your ADHD child's bedtime struggles are about their brain, not behaviour:

• Out of bed multiple times
• "One more thing" urgency
• Exhausted but can't settle
• Racing thoughts at night
• Calms with background sound

Sound familiar?

### Tweet D (Problem + Solution)
Your ADHD child's brain at bedtime:

Like a radio scanning for a station. Nothing to tune into. So it creates its own noise.

The fix? Give it something to land on.

Passive sound. Ambient. Consistent.

An anchor instead of silence.

### Tweet E (Timeline Reality)
ADHD bedtime routines:

Week 1: Feels pointless
Week 2: Small improvements
Week 4: Routine feels familiar
Week 6: Automatic settling starts

Most parents quit at week 1.

The ones who make it to week 6? Different household.

### Tweet F (Question Hook)
Why does your ADHD child suddenly need to:
• Find a toy from months ago
• Tell you something urgent
• Reorganise their bookshelf

at 9pm?

Revenge bedtime procrastination. The brain's last stand against losing control.

### Tweet G (Proof Point)
Sleep Foundation data:

Up to 75% of children with ADHD report sleep problems.

Three in four.

If bedtime is a battle in your house, you're not alone. And you're not failing.

The ADHD brain is just wired differently.

### Tweet H (Contrarian)
Stop trying to make your ADHD child's bedroom quieter.

The silence is the problem.

Their brain needs something to land on. Sound gives it an anchor.

Passive. Ambient. Consistent.

Not music. Not stories. Just gentle, unchanging audio.
