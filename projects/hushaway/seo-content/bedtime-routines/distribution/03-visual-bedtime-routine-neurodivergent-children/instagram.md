# Instagram Content: Visual Bedtime Routine for ND Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
You made the visual schedule.

But bedtime still feels hard.

Here's the missing piece →

[Bold text, high contrast design]

### Slide 2: The Problem
Visual schedules show WHAT comes next.

They don't help your child's body RESPOND.

The picture of bed doesn't make them feel sleepy.

### Slide 3: The Gap
Your child can look at the "bed" card and know bed is coming.

That doesn't mean their body is ready for bed.

Knowing ≠ Feeling

### Slide 4: The Solution
Pair visuals with sound.

Picture + consistent sound = automatic association

After 2 weeks, the brain connects them.

### Slide 5: How to Pair Them
Wind-down: Ambient begins
Bath/teeth: Ambient continues
Story: Shift to ASMR
Bed: Settling sounds
Overnight: Simple ambient

Same sounds every night.

### Slide 6: Why Sound Works
Visual schedules require attention.

Sound requires nothing.

It just works on the nervous system whether they engage or not.

Perfect for exhausted brains at 8pm.

### Slide 7: The Result
After 2 weeks:

Hearing the settling sound begins to calm your child BEFORE they reach bed.

That's automatic associations at work.

### Slide 8: Even If They Won't Look
Your child ignores the visual schedule?

The sound still works.

Auditory cues don't need eye contact or attention to shift the nervous system.

### Slide 9: Start Tonight
1. Choose one ambient soundscape
2. Play during wind-down
3. Shift to calming at "bed" card
4. Continue overnight

Same sounds tomorrow.

### Slide 10: CTA
Visual + sound = stronger signals.

## Caption

You made the visual schedule. Laminated every card. Added velcro dots. Hung it by the stairs.

And it helps. Sort of. Your child knows what comes next now. But bedtime still drags on. The transitions are still hard. They still struggle to settle once they're finally in bed.

.
.
.

Here's what nobody tells you about visual schedules: the picture of bed doesn't make your child feel sleepy. It just shows them what's coming.

That's the gap most parents never close. Visual supports are brilliant for reducing anxiety. Research backs this. But they work even better when you pair them with consistent sound cues at each transition.

Visuals tell your child what's coming. Sound tells their nervous system to respond.

When you add the same ambient soundscape during wind-down, the same settling sounds at the "bed" card, and the same overnight audio every single night, the brain builds automatic associations. After two weeks, just hearing the settling sound begins to calm your child before they even lie down.

Visual schedules require attention. Your child has to look, interpret, remember. That's mental work. And at 8pm after a full day? Their tired brain doesn't want mental work.

Sound requires nothing. It just enters their ears and starts working whether they engage or not.

If you're using visual schedules already, try adding one consistent sound tonight. Start simple. One ambient soundscape during wind-down. Keep it the same tomorrow night. And the next.

Your child's nervous system will start to recognise the pattern. The picture shows the information. The sound creates the response.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

## Reel Script (15-30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
[Visual: Parent holding laminated visual schedule cards, looking tired]

"You made the visual schedule. Every step. Perfect. But bedtime still feels impossible."

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
[Visual: Show visual card, then add sound wave graphic appearing]

"Here's what's missing: the picture of bed doesn't make your child feel sleepy. It just shows them what's coming.

Add consistent sound to each transition. Same ambient during wind-down. Same settling sounds at bed. Every night.

After two weeks, their brain builds automatic associations. Hearing the sound starts the settling, even before they look at the visual."

**[20-30 seconds: CTA]**
[Visual: Peaceful child settling in bed, sound waves in background]

"Visual shows what's coming. Sound tells the body to respond. You need both.

Follow for calm strategies that actually work."
