# Instagram Content: Bedtime Anxiety in Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
SOUND STAYS
WHEN YOU LEAVE

The calm answer to bedtime anxiety

### Slide 2: The Pattern
You know this dance.

"Don't leave."
"Just five more minutes."
"Stay until I fall asleep."

Eyes tracking your every move toward the door.

Two hours later, you're still there.

### Slide 3: This Isn't Manipulation
Your child genuinely believes:

When you leave → something bad happens
The dark → hides threats
Being alone → is dangerous

You can't reason them out of fear.

But you can help them feel safe.

### Slide 4: The Problem
Most advice: gradual retreat

Move from bed → chair → doorway → gone

Sounds logical.

But you're removing comfort without replacing it.

The silence stays equally empty.

### Slide 5: The Missing Piece
Your child doesn't need YOU to stay.

They need to feel not-alone.

Sound provides that.

Presence without your physical body.

### Slide 6: How It Works
When you leave → silence rushes in

But if sound is already playing → no emptiness

Same sound as when you were there

Their brain registers: Still safe

### Slide 7: 4 Fears, 1 Solution
**Separation**
Sound doesn't leave when you do

**Darkness**
Hearing fills the gap vision leaves

**Quiet**
External input quiets worries

**Control**
Predictable environment = safe

### Slide 8: The 4-Week Bridge
Week 1: Sound + you present
Week 2: Sound stays, you move away
Week 3: Sound continues, you leave
Week 4: Sound = safety object

Replacing comfort, not removing it.

### Slide 9: What Works
✓ Ambient frequencies
✓ Continuous ASMR (no speech)
✓ Consistent nature sounds
✓ Audio that runs all night

✗ Music with melodies
✗ Guided meditations
✗ Audio that stops

### Slide 10: The Shift
In a few weeks:

You say goodnight.
You press play.
You walk to the door.

No wide eyes.
No "don't leave."

Just a child settling into the sound that stays.

## Caption

Standing in the doorway. Again.

Your child's eyes locked on you—wide, watchful, tracking every movement.

"Just five more minutes."

.
.
.

We've worked with hundreds of families living this exact pattern. The two-hour gradual retreat. The broken promises. The guilt when you finally close that door.

Here's what changes everything: your child doesn't need you to stay. They need something to stay.

Sound stays when you leave the room.

When you leave, silence rushes in. But if sound is already playing, your leaving doesn't create emptiness. The auditory environment stays consistent. Same sound as when you were there. Still safe.

Different sounds address different fears. Separation: sound doesn't leave. Darkness: hearing fills the gap vision leaves. Quiet: external input quiets worries. Sound provides presence without your physical body.

You're not abandoning them. You're teaching them that safety doesn't depend on your physical presence. You're giving them a tool they can use tonight, and every night.

Sound stays when you leave.

For an anxious child, that's everything.

## Reel Script (15-30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your child won't let you leave at bedtime. Here's why gradual retreat fails."

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
"Gradual retreat says: move from bed, to chair, to doorway, to gone.

But you're removing comfort without replacing it.

The silence stays equally empty.

Here's what works: Sound stays when you leave.

Sound provides presence without your physical body. Different sounds address different fears.

Week one: sound plays while you're there.
Week four: sound is their safety object."

**[20-30 seconds: CTA]**
"You're not abandoning them. You're teaching them safety doesn't require your physical presence.

Follow for more calm solutions."
