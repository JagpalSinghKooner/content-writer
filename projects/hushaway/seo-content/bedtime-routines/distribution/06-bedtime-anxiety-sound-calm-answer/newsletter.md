# Newsletter Snippet: Bedtime Anxiety in Children

## Hook

You're standing in the doorway. Again. Your child's eyes locked on you—wide, watchful, tracking your every movement. "Just five more minutes. Don't close the door. Stay until I fall asleep."

## Body

We've worked with hundreds of families living this exact pattern. The gradual retreat that stretches to two hours. The promises broken because exhaustion wins. The guilt when you finally close that door and hear the sobbing start.

Here's what changes everything: your child doesn't need you to stay. They need something to stay. Sound stays when you leave the room.

Not as a trick. As genuine support for the thing your child actually fears—emptiness when you're gone. When you leave, silence rushes in. But if sound is already playing, your leaving doesn't create that scary quiet. The auditory environment stays consistent. Same sound as when you were there. Still safe.

Different sounds address different fears. Separation anxiety: sound doesn't leave when you do. Fear of the dark: hearing fills the gap vision leaves. Fear of quiet: external input quiets internal worries. Sound bridges the gap between your being there and their learning to feel safe alone.

You're not abandoning them when you leave the room. You're teaching them that safety doesn't depend on your physical presence. You're giving them a tool they can use tonight, and every night, without requiring anything from you.

## Alternative: Teaser Format

**This week:** Why sound stays when you leave the room

Your child has bedtime anxiety. Here's what we've learned after years of working with families just like yours:

• Bedtime anxiety stems from 4 core fears (separation, dark, quiet, losing control)
• Gradual retreat often fails because you're removing comfort without replacing it
• Sound provides presence without requiring you to stay physically
• Different sounds address different fears specifically
• Sound + gradual retreat together is more powerful than either alone

Picture this in a few weeks: You say goodnight. You press play. You walk to the door. No wide eyes tracking your retreat. Just a child settling into the sound that stays.
