# Instagram Content: Autism Bedtime Routine

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
YOUR AUTISTIC CHILD
KNOWS THE SCHEDULE

But still stands frozen
at the bathroom door

Why routine structure isn't enough →

### Slide 2: The Reality
Visual schedule ✓
Same steps every night ✓
Bath → Teeth → Story ✓

Still:
❌ Frozen refusal
❌ Meltdowns
❌ Eyes wide open at 10pm

### Slide 3: The Missing Piece
Knowing the schedule
≠
Feeling safe within it

### Slide 4: Questions You Can't Hear
Your child's brain is asking:

"Will mum say goodnight
exactly like last night?"

"Will the light sound the same?"

"What if something is different?"

### Slide 5: Why Sound Works
Sound provides consistent,
predictable input that:

✓ Doesn't vary
✓ Doesn't require processing
✓ Doesn't ask anything

It just arrives.
Identical. Every night.

### Slide 6: Four-Phase Approach
1. Wind-down
   (ambient soundscapes)

2. Active routine
   (consistent audio anchor)

3. Connection time
   (gentle frequencies)

4. Sleep
   (continuous bridge)

### Slide 7: Sound Bridges Your Departure
When you leave the room,
your presence goes with you.

But sound stays.

It fills the silence that
triggers bedtime anxiety.

### Slide 8: Gradual Retreat That Works
Traditional method:
Progress → Regression → Tears

Sound-supported method:
Sound stays constant →
Position changes gradually →
Child learns sound = safety

### Slide 9: Timeline
Week 1-2:
Introduce the sound

Week 3-4:
Begin position changes

Week 5+:
Continue retreat

8-12 weeks for lasting change

### Slide 10: CTA
If bedtime is a battle,
predictable sound might be
the missing piece.

## Caption

The visual schedule is on the wall. The routine is identical every night. And your autistic child still stands frozen at the bathroom door.

.
.
.

Here's what nobody tells you: for autistic children, knowing the schedule isn't the same as feeling safe within it. The steps can be identical every night, and the transitions can still feel terrifying.

Your child's brain is asking questions you can't hear: Will mum say goodnight exactly like last night? Will the bathroom light sound the same? What if something is different?

That's where sound becomes something more than background noise. Sound can be the one predictable element that stays identical, every single night, through every transition. The same frequencies. The same ambient patterns. The same auditory signal that tells your child's nervous system: "You know this. This is sleep time. You're safe."

Unlike verbal cues (which vary with your mood and tiredness), unlike visual schedules (which require active processing), sound just arrives. Your child doesn't need to do anything. And if the same sound plays at the same point in the routine every single night, your child's brain learns to associate that specific audio with that specific transition.

The sound becomes the predictability. And that changes everything.
