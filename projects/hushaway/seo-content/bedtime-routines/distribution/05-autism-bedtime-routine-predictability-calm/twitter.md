# Twitter/X Content: Autism Bedtime Routine

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your autistic child knows the schedule.

Same steps every night. Same routine on the wall.

And still stands frozen at the bathroom door.

Why routine structure isn't enough (and what actually works):

🧵

### Tweet 2
For autistic children, knowing the schedule ≠ feeling safe within it.

Your child's brain is asking questions you can't hear:

• Will mum say goodnight exactly like last night?
• Will the light sound the same?
• What if something is different?

### Tweet 3
The numbers:

50-80% of autistic children experience sleep difficulties.

That's 2-3x the rate of neurotypical children.

If bedtime feels impossibly hard in your house, you're not imagining it.

### Tweet 4
Transitions mean unpredictability.

Think about what bedtime requires:
• Stop activity
• Move to another room
• Change clothes
• Adjust to different lighting
• Shift from active to still
• Move from together to alone

6+ transitions in under an hour.

### Tweet 5
Most bedtime advice: "Keep the routine consistent."

That's a start. But structure alone doesn't solve the problem.

Why? Because your child needs sensory predictability, not just sequential sameness.

### Tweet 6
This is where sound changes everything.

Sound provides consistent, predictable input that:
• Doesn't vary like verbal cues
• Doesn't require processing like visual schedules
• Doesn't ask anything from your child

It just arrives. Identical. Every night.

### Tweet 7
Four-phase sound routine:

1. Wind-down (30-45min before): ambient soundscapes
2. Active routine (bath/teeth): consistent audio anchor
3. Connection time (story): gentle frequencies
4. Sleep (you leave): continuous sound that bridges your departure

### Tweet 8
The sound bridges the alone-to-together gap.

When you leave the room, your presence goes with you.

But sound stays.

It fills the silence that so often triggers bedtime anxiety.

### Tweet 9
Sound-supported gradual retreat works when traditional methods fail.

Why?

Traditional: your position changes = entire sensory landscape changes

With sound: sound stays constant while your position gradually shifts

Your child learns the sound is the anchor, not your physical presence.

### Tweet 10
Timeline expectations:

Week 1-2: Introduce sound at current position
Week 3-4: Begin position changes, sound stays constant
Week 5+: Continue retreat

8-12 weeks for autistic children.

This isn't a race. It's lasting change.

### Tweet 11
What to look for after 2-3 weeks:
• Natural wind-down when sound starts
• Reduced transition rigidity
• Faster sleep onset

After 6-8 weeks:
• Established routine confidence
• Less bedtime anxiety
• Your child knows: this sound = safe

### Tweet 12
TL;DR:

• Autistic children need sensory predictability, not just routine structure
• Sound provides consistent input that doesn't vary or require processing
• Same sounds at same times every night = safety signal
• Sound bridges transitions and your departure
• 8-12 weeks for lasting change

### Tweet 13 (Wrap)
If bedtime is a battle in your house, predictable sound might be the missing piece.

The Open Sanctuary from HushAway has sounds designed for autistic children.

Worth exploring if nothing else has worked.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
For autistic children: knowing the bedtime schedule isn't the same as feeling safe within it.

Your child's brain is asking "what if something is different?"

Sound becomes the one predictable element that never changes.

Every single night. Identical.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

Visual schedules don't solve bedtime struggles for autistic children.

They require active processing. They need interpretation. They vary in execution.

Sound just arrives. No processing required. Identical every time.

That's the difference.

### Tweet C (List)
3 things that vary at bedtime (even in "consistent" routines):

• Your voice tone (tired days, stressed days, rushed days)
• Your energy level (affects how you interact)
• Your physical presence (feels different night to night)

Sound is identical. Every single time.

### Tweet D (Statistics)
50-80% of autistic children experience sleep difficulties.

2-3x the rate of neurotypical children.

The struggle is real. The exhaustion is real.

And routine structure alone doesn't solve it.

### Tweet E (Problem/Solution)
Traditional gradual retreat for autistic children:

Progress one night → Regression the next → Tears → Start over

Sound-supported gradual retreat:

Sound stays constant → Your position changes → Child's brain learns sound = safety anchor → Lasting progress

Big difference.
