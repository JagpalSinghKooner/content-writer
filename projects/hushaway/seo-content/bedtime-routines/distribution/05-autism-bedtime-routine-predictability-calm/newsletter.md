# Newsletter Snippet: Autism Bedtime Routine

## Hook

The visual schedule is on the wall. The routine is identical every night. Bath at 7. Teeth at 7:15. Story at 7:30. And your autistic child still stands frozen at the bathroom door, refusing to move.

## Body

We've been there. So many of us have.

Here's what nobody tells you: for autistic children, knowing the schedule isn't the same as feeling safe within it. The steps can be identical every night, and the transitions can still feel terrifying.

Because an autism bedtime routine that works isn't about the sequence. It's about reducing the uncertainty that makes each step feel unsafe. Your child's brain is asking questions you can't hear: Will mum say goodnight exactly like last night? Will the bathroom light sound the same? What if something is different?

That's where sound becomes something more than background noise. Sound can be the one predictable element that stays identical, every single night, through every transition. The same frequencies. The same ambient patterns. The same auditory signal that tells your child's nervous system: "You know this. This is sleep time. You're safe."

Unlike verbal cues (which vary with your mood), unlike visual schedules (which require processing), sound just arrives. Your child doesn't need to do anything. And if the same sound plays at the same point in the routine every single night, your child's brain learns to associate that specific audio with that specific transition.

The sound becomes the predictability.

If bedtime is a battle in your house, this approach might be the missing piece. Discover how to build a four-phase sound routine that reduces transition anxiety and helps your autistic child feel genuinely safe at bedtime.

**This week:** Why routine structure isn't enough for autistic children at bedtime

Between 50-80% of autistic children experience sleep difficulties. That's 2-3 times the rate of neurotypical children. If bedtime feels impossibly hard in your house, you're not imagining it.

Learn:
• Why knowing the schedule ≠ feeling safe within it
• How sound provides sensory predictability (not just sequential sameness)
• The four-phase approach that works when structure alone doesn't
• Sound-supported gradual retreat that actually succeeds
