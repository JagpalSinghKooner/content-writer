# Newsletter Snippet: Sound-Based Bedtime Routine

## Hook

Every sleep expert says "try calming sounds at bedtime." Nobody tells you WHICH sounds, when to play them, or why your child looks at you like you've suggested listening to dial-up internet when you press play on that Spotify "calm" playlist.

## Body

You're not doing it wrong. The advice is incomplete.

Sound CAN genuinely transform bedtime for neurodivergent children. But generic calming music fails because it's designed for neurotypical brains. Unpredictable tempo changes, melodies that engage pattern recognition, playlists that end just as your child was starting to settle.

Here's what actually works: matching the RIGHT sound type to your child's specific brain, starting 60-90 minutes before bed (not at lights-out), and using the SAME sound every night for at least two weeks so the brain can build associations.

Ambient soundscapes work for sensory-sensitive children who need zero cognitive demand. ASMR helps sensory-seeking children (though only about 20% of people experience the ASMR response). Frequencies and binaural beats give ADHD racing brains something steady to land on. Gentle narration provides presence for children with separation anxiety.

The timing matters as much as the sound itself. Start very quiet ambient background 60-90 minutes before bed. Continue it during physical wind-down. Shift to more focused calming content once your child's in bed. Return to simple ambient soundscapes for overnight. Sound woven through the entire routine does gradual work. Sound only at lights-out does nothing.

Most parents give up after three nights because "it didn't work." The brain needs 7-14 nights of repetition to build the automatic "this sound means settle" response. Three nights isn't enough data.

## CTA

We created The Open Sanctuary specifically for this. Sounds designed for neurodivergent children. Ambient soundscapes without sudden changes. Frequencies at the right levels. ASMR that doesn't overwhelm. Gentle narration without instructions to follow.

You press play. The sound does the work. Zero effort from exhausted parents.

**This week:** The specific sound-based bedtime routine guidance exhausted parents actually need

Every expert says "try calming sounds." Nobody tells you:

• Which sound types work for which ND profiles (ADHD vs autism vs sensory-sensitive)
• When to start sound (not at lights-out—60-90 minutes before)
• Why generic playlists fail (unpredictable changes wake sensitive brains)
• Common mistakes that sabotage sound routines (volume, timing, giving up too soon)
• How to match sound to YOUR child's specific challenges
