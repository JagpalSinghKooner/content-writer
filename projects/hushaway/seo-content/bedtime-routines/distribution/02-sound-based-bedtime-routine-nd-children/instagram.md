# Instagram Content: Sound-Based Bedtime Routine

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
Everyone says
"TRY CALMING SOUNDS"

Nobody tells you
WHICH, WHEN, or WHY

[Bold text, high contrast - calming colour palette]

### Slide 2: The Problem
Generic "sleep playlists" FAIL neurodivergent children

Why?
Unpredictable changes
Melodies that engage the brain
Playlists that end too soon

ND brains need sounds BUILT for them

### Slide 3: Ambient Soundscapes
RAIN • OCEAN • FOREST

✓ Zero cognitive demand
✓ Fills silence without attention
✓ Works all night

Best for: Sensory-sensitive children, ages 0-5

### Slide 4: ASMR Sounds
WHISPERS • TAPPING • SOFT TEXTURES

✓ Triggers relaxation response
✓ Satisfies sensory-seeking
✓ Gentle presence

Only ~20% respond to ASMR
(If your child doesn't, that's normal)

### Slide 5: Frequencies
STEADY TONES • BINAURAL BEATS

✓ Gives racing brain anchor point
✓ No melody to follow
✓ Maximum predictability

Best for: ADHD racing thoughts, ages 8+

### Slide 6: Gentle Narration
SLEEP STORIES • SOFT SPEAKING

✓ Provides presence without person
✓ Anchors racing thoughts
✓ No instructions to follow

Avoid: Exciting plots or cliffhangers

### Slide 7: Timing Changes Everything
60-90 min before bed → Ambient starts
30-45 min before bed → Continue through bath/teeth
15-30 min before bed → Shift to focused calming
Sleep + overnight → Back to ambient

Sound does GRADUAL work
Not instant magic at lights-out

### Slide 8: Common Mistakes
❌ Starting sound too late
❌ Volume too high
❌ Variable playlists
❌ Giving up after 3 nights

✅ Same sound, same time, 2 weeks minimum

The brain needs repetition

### Slide 9: Match Sound to Brain
ADHD racing → Frequencies or ambient
Autistic anxiety → Same sound nightly
Sensory-seeking → ASMR
Sensory-avoiding → Ambient only
Separation anxiety → Gentle narration

Your child's brain
Your child's sound

### Slide 10: CTA
Your child isn't broken

Their brain just needs the right sound at the right time

## Caption

Every expert says "try calming sounds at bedtime."

Nobody tells you WHICH sounds. Or when to play them. Or why your child hates every sleep playlist you've tried.

.
.
.

You're not doing it wrong. The advice is incomplete.

Generic calming music fails neurodivergent children because it's designed for neurotypical brains. Tempo changes create alertness spikes. Melodies engage the brain in pattern recognition. Playlists end right when your child was starting to settle.

Sound CAN transform bedtime. But it needs to be the RIGHT sound, at the RIGHT time, used the RIGHT way.

Ambient soundscapes work for sensory-sensitive children (zero cognitive demand). ASMR helps sensory-seeking children (though only 20% of people respond to it). Frequencies give ADHD racing brains something steady to land on. Gentle narration provides presence for separation anxiety.

Timing matters as much as sound type. Start 60-90 minutes BEFORE bed, not at lights-out. Let sound do gradual work across the entire wind-down. Use the same sound every night for at least two weeks so the brain can build associations.

Three nights isn't enough data. Give it 14.

We created The Open Sanctuary specifically for neurodivergent children. Sounds designed for how ND brains actually work. Ambient soundscapes without sudden changes. Frequencies at the right levels. ASMR that doesn't overwhelm. Gentle narration without instructions.

You press play. The sound does the work. Zero effort from exhausted parents.

## Visual Notes

**Carousel Design:**
- Calming colour palette: soft blues, gentle purples, warm neutrals
- High contrast for readability (dark text on light backgrounds or vice versa)
- Minimal design—one key point per slide
- Use icons for sound types (wave for ambient, headphones for ASMR, waveform for frequencies, book for narration)
- Slide 1 should have bold, attention-grabbing text

**Reel B-Roll Suggestions:**
- Close-up of peaceful sleeping child
- Sound wave visualisations
- Parent pressing play on device
- Peaceful bedroom environment
- Clock/timer showing routine phases
- The Open Sanctuary interface (if showing product)

**Keep visual style:**
- Warm and reassuring (not clinical)
- Parent-to-parent feel
- Soft, calming aesthetics that match brand voice
- No overwhelming busy visuals (remember the audience is sensory-aware)
