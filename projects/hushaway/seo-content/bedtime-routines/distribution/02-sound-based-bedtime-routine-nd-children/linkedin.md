# LinkedIn Content: Sound-Based Bedtime Routine

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
Everyone says "try calming sounds at bedtime"

But nobody tells you WHICH sounds, WHEN to play them, or WHY they work

Swipe → for the specific guidance exhausted parents actually need

### Slide 2: Why Generic Advice Fails
Generic "calming music" fails neurodivergent children because:

• Classical music has unpredictable tempo changes (alertness spikes)
• Melodies engage pattern recognition (more mental activity)
• Playlists end (child wakes when sound stops)
• Chosen by someone else (doesn't match THEIR sensory profile)

ND brains need sound designed FOR them, not adapted FROM neurotypical advice.

### Slide 3: What Actually Works - Ambient Soundscapes
**Best for:** Sensory-sensitive children, ages 0-5

**Why:** Zero cognitive demand. Rain, ocean, forest sounds fill silence without requiring attention.

**When:** Start 60-90 minutes before bed, continue all night

**Volume:** Barely noticeable background presence

### Slide 4: What Actually Works - ASMR Sounds
**Best for:** Children who experience relaxation from soft sounds

**Why:** Gentle textures (whispering, tapping, brushing) trigger physiological relaxation response

**When:** During active wind-down, 15-30 minutes before sleep

**Note:** About 20% of people respond to ASMR. If your child doesn't, that's completely normal.

### Slide 5: What Actually Works - Frequencies
**Best for:** ADHD children with racing thoughts, ages 8+

**Why:** Steady, unchanging tones give the racing brain something to land on

**When:** Final settling phase, once in bed

**Important:** Binaural beats need headphones (not all children tolerate them)

### Slide 6: What Actually Works - Gentle Narration
**Best for:** Children transitioning from parent presence, those with racing thoughts

**Why:** Gives the brain something to follow without demanding engagement

**When:** Main settling activity, after physical wind-down

**Avoid:** Exciting plots or cliffhangers (brain stays active)

### Slide 7: The Timing That Changes Everything
Sound isn't just "at bedtime." It's woven through the entire wind-down.

**60-90 min before bed:** Ambient background starts
**30-45 min before bed:** Continue during bath, teeth
**15-30 min before bed:** Shift to focused calming content
**Sleep + overnight:** Return to ambient soundscapes

The brain needs time to build associations. Sound does gradual work.

### Slide 8: Common Mistakes
**Starting sound too late:** Asking it to do all the work in 5 minutes

**Volume too high:** Should fade into background awareness

**Using variable playlists:** Each transition wakes a sensitive brain

**Giving up after 3 nights:** The brain needs 7-14 nights to build associations

**Fix:** Same sound, same time, same routine for 2 weeks minimum.

### Slide 9: Match Sound to Challenge
**Racing ADHD brain:** Frequencies or ambient soundscapes

**Autistic transition anxiety:** Consistency matters more than type (same sound nightly)

**Sensory-seeking:** ASMR works well

**Sensory-avoiding:** Ambient only (no voice)

**Separation anxiety:** Gentle narration provides presence

### Slide 10: CTA
Your child isn't broken. Their brain just needs the right sound at the right time.

Every expert says "try calming sounds at bedtime."

Nobody tells you WHICH sounds. Or when. Or why your child hates every "sleep playlist" you've tried.

You're not doing it wrong. The advice is incomplete.

Here's what actually works for neurodivergent children:

**1. Timing matters more than sound type**

Starting sound when your child gets into bed asks it to do all the settling work in minutes. That's too much pressure.

Start 60-90 minutes before bed. Let sound do gradual work across the entire wind-down. After a week, your child's brain starts settling automatically when they hear the evening soundscape.

**2. Predictability beats variety**

That Spotify playlist that moves from rain to piano to chimes? Each transition wakes up a sensitive brain waiting for change.

Choose ONE sound type. Use the SAME sound every night. Consistency is how the brain learns "this sound means settle."

**3. Match sound to brain, not age**

ADHD children with racing thoughts respond to frequencies (steady anchor points). Autistic children with transition anxiety need the same predictable sound nightly. Sensory-seeking children often love ASMR textures.

Generic "calming" playlists weren't designed for your child's specific sensory profile.

**4. Volume should fade into background**

If your child is actively listening, volume is too high. You're creating an environment, not an activity. Sound should be present but not demanding attention.

The right sound, played at the right time, genuinely changes bedtime. But it takes 7-14 nights for the brain to build associations.

Three nights isn't enough data. Give it two weeks.

We created The Open Sanctuary for exactly this situation. Sounds designed specifically for neurodivergent brains. Ambient soundscapes without sudden changes. Frequencies at the right levels. ASMR that doesn't overwhelm. Gentle narration without instructions.

You press play. The sound does the work.

Last week, a parent told me: "We've tried white noise, rain sounds, meditation apps. Nothing works for my child."

I asked: "When did you start the sound?"

"At lights-out."

That's the problem.

Sound doesn't work in isolation. It works woven through the entire bedtime routine, starting 60-90 minutes before sleep.

Here's the structure that transforms bedtime for neurodivergent children:

**Phase 1: Household Shift (60-90 minutes before bed)**

Very quiet ambient background. Barely noticeable. This isn't the main event. It's changing the acoustic environment from "daytime" to "evening."

After a week, your child's brain starts associating this soundscape with approaching bedtime. Their body prepares without you saying a word.

**Phase 2: Physical Wind-Down (30-45 minutes before bed)**

Continue ambient background during bath, teeth, pyjamas. Sound provides continuity across transitions.

Same audio through physical wind-down tells your child's brain: "This is all one connected routine, not separate stressful moments."

**Phase 3: In-Bedroom Settling (15-30 minutes before sleep)**

Shift to focused calming content. ASMR, frequencies, or sleep stories. The sound becomes the main activity.

This is where your child's brain shifts from "doing things" to "doing nothing." Sound fills that space without requiring effort.

**Phase 4: Sleep Onset and Overnight**

Return to ambient soundscapes. Lower complexity. No narration. Just consistent, predictable audio.

If your child wakes briefly at 2am, hearing the same familiar sound helps them resettle without fully waking.

Most parents try sound only at lights-out and wonder why it doesn't work. You're asking it to do four phases of work in one moment.

Start earlier. Let sound do gradual work across the entire wind-down.

The Open Sanctuary has sounds designed for each phase. Ambient for background. ASMR for active settling. Frequencies for final wind-down. All created specifically for neurodivergent children.

Your child's brain isn't broken because meditation apps don't work.

Meditation apps are designed for neurotypical brains. "Focus on your breath." "Notice your thoughts." "Follow this visualisation."

For a neurodivergent child, that's not calming. It's work.

ADHD brains can't focus on breath when thoughts are racing. Autistic brains resist instructions that feel unpredictable. Sensory-sensitive brains get overwhelmed by guided imagery creating mental pictures.

What works instead? Passive listening.

No following along. No instructions. No interaction required. Just press play.

This is why we built The Open Sanctuary specifically for neurodivergent children.

Ambient soundscapes that fill silence without demanding attention. Frequencies that give racing brains something steady to land on. ASMR that satisfies sensory-seeking without overwhelming. Gentle narration that provides presence without requiring responses.

Your child doesn't need to DO anything. The sound does the work while they rest.

One parent told us: "It's the first thing that's ever worked without requiring more energy from us."

That's exactly what exhausted parents need. Zero-effort solutions that actually work.

If meditation apps have failed your child, it's not your child's fault. They were never designed for ND brains in the first place.

Try sounds built for how your child's brain actually works.
