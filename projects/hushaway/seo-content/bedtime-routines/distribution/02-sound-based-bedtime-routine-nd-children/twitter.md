# Twitter/X Content: Sound-Based Bedtime Routine

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Everyone says "try calming sounds at bedtime"

But nobody tells you WHICH sounds, WHEN, or WHY rain sounds make your child MORE alert

Here's what actually works for neurodivergent children

🧵 Thread:

### Tweet 2
First: Generic "calming music" fails ND children for a reason

Classical music has tempo changes (alertness spikes)
Melodies engage pattern recognition (more mental work)
Playlists end (child wakes when sound stops)

Your child's brain needs sound DESIGNED for it, not adapted

### Tweet 3
**Sound Type 1: Ambient Soundscapes**

Rain, ocean, forest sounds. Zero cognitive demand.

Best for: Sensory-sensitive children, ages 0-5
When: Start 60-90 min before bed, continue all night
Volume: Background presence, not focal point

The brain can rest without needing to process anything

### Tweet 4
**Sound Type 2: ASMR**

Whispering, tapping, soft textures

Best for: Children who relax with gentle sounds
When: Active wind-down, 15-30 min before sleep

Important: Only ~20% of people experience ASMR. If your child doesn't respond, that's completely normal

### Tweet 5
**Sound Type 3: Frequencies & Binaural Beats**

Steady, unchanging tones

Best for: ADHD racing thoughts, ages 8+
When: Final settling phase, once in bed

Why it works: Gives the wandering brain somewhere to land without demanding engagement

### Tweet 6
**Sound Type 4: Gentle Narration**

Sleep stories, soft-spoken content (no instructions)

Best for: Racing thoughts, separation anxiety
When: Main settling activity

Avoid: Exciting plots or cliffhangers. Brain should relax, not wonder what happens next

### Tweet 7
Timing is where most parents get it wrong

Starting sound at lights-out asks it to do all the work in 5 minutes

Start 60-90 minutes BEFORE bed. Let it do gradual work across the entire wind-down

After a week, the brain starts settling automatically when it hears the evening soundscape

Common mistakes:

❌ Starting sound too late
❌ Volume too high (should fade into background)
❌ Using playlists with variation
❌ Giving up after 3 nights

✅ Same sound, same time, 2 weeks minimum

The brain needs repetition to build associations

### Tweet 9
Match sound to your child's specific challenge:

ADHD racing brain → Frequencies or ambient
Autistic transition anxiety → Same sound nightly (consistency)
Sensory-seeking → ASMR
Sensory-avoiding → Ambient only (no voice)
Separation anxiety → Gentle narration

### Tweet 10 (Wrap)
Your child isn't broken. Their brain just needs the right sound at the right time.

We built @HushAwayHQ's Open Sanctuary specifically for ND children:
• Ambient soundscapes
• Frequencies
• ASMR
• Gentle narration

All passive listening. Zero effort.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Meditation apps fail neurodivergent children for a reason:

"Focus on your breath" → ADHD brain can't
"Follow this visualisation" → Autistic brain resists instructions
"Notice your thoughts" → More work, not less

What works? Passive listening. Press play. That's it. No instructions required.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

If your child hates every "calming sleep playlist," they're not the problem.

Generic playlists are designed for neurotypical brains. Tempo changes, melody variations, unpredictable endings.

ND brains need sounds BUILT for them, not adapted.

### Tweet C (List)
5 sounds that help neurodivergent children sleep:

• Ambient soundscapes (rain, ocean, forest)
• ASMR (whispering, tapping, soft textures)
• Frequencies (steady tones for racing thoughts)
• Gentle narration (sleep stories without excitement)
• White/pink/brown noise (consistent, predictable)

Match sound to YOUR child's brain, not generic advice

### Tweet D (Problem/Solution)
The problem with "try white noise":

Which type? When do you start it? How loud? What if it stops at 2am and your child wakes?

Generic advice assumes you know the details.

You don't. Because nobody teaches them.

Here's what actually matters: Timing, volume, consistency, duration.

### Tweet E (Data Hook)
Research shows broadband sound helps people fall asleep 38% faster

But here's what the study doesn't tell parents:

• WHEN to start the sound (not at lights-out)
• WHICH sound type for which brain
• HOW to build the association over time

Science + parent reality = what actually works
