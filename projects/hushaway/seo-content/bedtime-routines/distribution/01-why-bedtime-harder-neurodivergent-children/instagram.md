# Instagram Content: Why Bedtime is Harder for Neurodivergent Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
**BEDTIME ISN'T A DISCIPLINE PROBLEM**

It's a neurology problem

[Bold white text on deep navy background]

### Slide 2: The Reality
Up to 80% of autistic children
+
75% of ADHD children

struggle at bedtime

**This is neurology, not behaviour**

### Slide 3: The ADHD Brain
Won't. Switch. Off.

Racing thoughts don't respond to "just close your eyes"

The brain comes ALIVE at night when the world finally gets quiet

### Slide 4: The Autistic Brain
Bedtime looks like routine

But it's actually 7+ transitions in 60 minutes

**Each one a potential anxiety trigger**

### Slide 5: The Paradox
Overtired = Hyperactive

Their nervous system compensates for exhaustion by ramping UP, not down

The exhausted child who can't stop bouncing?

**That's biology, not defiance**

### Slide 6: Your Bedroom vs Theirs
**You hear:** Quiet

**They hear:**
• Humming electronics
• Ticking clocks
• Floorboard creaks
• Every. Single. Sound.

Sensory overload doesn't stop at bedtime

### Slide 7: Why "Be Consistent" Fails
ADHD: automaticity is harder
One disruption resets the system

Autism: they need consistency in every sensory DETAIL, not just sequence

Both: tiredness ≠ sleepiness

### Slide 8: What Actually Helps
✓ Predictability beyond routine
✓ Something for the brain to land on
✓ Sensory-aware environments
✓ Longer wind-down periods (60+ min)
✓ Trust what they tell you bothers them

### Slide 9: Remove the Guilt
You're not failing

ND bedtime struggles aren't created by permissive parenting

They're not fixed by stricter parenting

**You're parenting a child whose neurology requires different tools**

## Caption

It's 9:47pm. Your child is wide awake.

You've done everything the books say. Star charts, earlier bedtimes, screens off at 6pm, warm milk, lavender spray, weighted blankets, routines so rigid you could set a clock by them.

And still. Every. Single. Night.

.
.
.

Here's what the parenting books don't tell you: your child isn't being defiant. They're not testing boundaries. They're not "just overtired." Their brain works differently. And that difference doesn't clock off when the lights go down.

**The ADHD brain won't switch off.** Racing thoughts don't respond to "just close your eyes." The brain is under-stimulated during the day, then comes alive at night when the world gets quiet. No structure. No distractions. Just every thought pushed aside since breakfast.

**The autistic brain craves predictability, but bedtime is chaos disguised as routine.** Leaving dinner, walking upstairs, running a bath, choosing pyjamas, brushing teeth, getting into bed, lights off, door closed. Seven transitions in under an hour. Each one a potential anxiety trigger.

And the paradox that confuses everyone: overtiredness triggers hyperactivity in many neurodivergent children. Their nervous system compensates for exhaustion by ramping up, not down. The exhausted child who can't stop bouncing? That's not defiance. That's biology.

If you've been blaming yourself, please stop. Right now. You're not failing because star charts don't work. You're parenting a child whose neurology requires different tools. Tools that weren't in the parenting books because those books weren't written for your child.

What works is understanding why bedtime is hard, then finding approaches that match your child's actual brain. Sometimes that means something as simple as giving their racing thoughts an anchor—passive sound that asks nothing in return. No meditation. No instructions. Just sound that provides something for the brain to land on.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Sometimes finding that moment starts with understanding why the loud moments exist.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"It's 9:47pm. Your child is wide awake. You've tried everything. Here's what's actually happening..."

[Visual: Parent looking exhausted, child wide awake in background]

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
"Up to 80% of autistic children and 75% of ADHD children struggle at bedtime. Not because they're being difficult—because their brains work differently.

The ADHD brain comes alive when the world gets quiet. Racing thoughts need somewhere to land.

The autistic brain experiences bedtime as 7+ anxiety-triggering transitions in 60 minutes.

And overtiredness? It triggers hyperactivity, not sleep.

This isn't discipline. It's neurology."

"Remove the guilt. You're not failing. You're parenting a child whose brain needs different tools.
