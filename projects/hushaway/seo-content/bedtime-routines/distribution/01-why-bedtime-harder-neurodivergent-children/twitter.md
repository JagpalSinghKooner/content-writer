# Twitter/X Content: Why Bedtime is Harder for Neurodivergent Children

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
It's 9:47pm. Your neurodivergent child is wide awake.

You've done everything the books say. Star charts, earlier bedtimes, weighted blankets, rigid routines.

Still doesn't work.

Here's what's actually happening in their brain at bedtime:

🧵 Thread:

### Tweet 2
First, the reality:

Up to 80% of autistic children struggle at bedtime.
75% of ADHD children can't fall asleep easily.

This isn't a discipline problem. It's neurology.

And once you understand what's happening, you can stop fighting it and start working with it.

### Tweet 3
The ADHD brain won't switch off.

Racing thoughts don't respond to "just close your eyes."

The ADHD brain is under-stimulated during the day, then comes ALIVE at night when the world gets quiet.

No structure. No distractions. Just a brain with nothing to focus on except every thought since breakfast.

### Tweet 4
The autistic brain craves predictability—but bedtime is chaos disguised as routine.

Think about it:
• Leave dinner
• Walk upstairs
• Run bath
• Choose pyjamas
• Brush teeth
• Get into bed
• Lights off

That's 7+ transitions in under an hour. Each one a potential anxiety trigger.

### Tweet 5
Here's the paradox that confuses everyone:

Overtiredness triggers HYPERACTIVITY in many ND children.

Their nervous system compensates for exhaustion by ramping UP, not down.

The exhausted child who can't stop bouncing? That's not defiance. That's biology.

### Tweet 6
Your bedroom is quiet.

Their bedroom is chaos.

Sensory inputs neurotypical brains filter out:
• Humming electronics
• Sheet textures
• Pyjama pressure
• Streetlights through curtains
• Temperature differences
• That floorboard creak downstairs

Every single one demands attention.

### Tweet 7
Research suggests many ND children have atypical melatonin patterns.

Their body clock runs on a different schedule.

An 8pm bedtime for your child might feel like a 6pm bedtime for neurotypical peers.

You're not fighting defiance. You're fighting biology.

### Tweet 8
Why "just be consistent" doesn't work:

For ADHD children: automaticity is harder. One disruption resets the whole system.

For autistic children: consistency in SEQUENCE isn't enough. They need consistency in every sensory detail.

For both: tiredness ≠ sleepiness.

### Tweet 9
What actually helps:

**Predictability beyond routine**
Same sounds, lighting, words at the same moment

**Something for the brain to land on**
Silence is the enemy. Passive sound gives racing thoughts an anchor.

**Longer wind-down periods**
60+ minutes, not 30

### Tweet 10
**Sensory-aware environments**

This might mean:
• Blackout curtains
• Specific sheet textures
• Removing ticking clocks
• Ambient soundscapes
• Temperature control

Trust what your child tells you bothers them. Even when it seems minor.

### Tweet 11
Remove the guilt.

Neurodivergent bedtime struggles aren't created by permissive parenting.

They're not fixed by stricter parenting.

You're not failing because star charts don't work.

You're parenting a child whose neurology requires different tools.

### Tweet 12 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• 75-80% of ND children struggle at bedtime
• It's neurological, not behavioural
• ADHD: racing thoughts need an anchor
• Autism: transitions create anxiety
• Generic advice misses these realities
• Different brains need different tools

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Neurodivergent bedtime struggles:

Most people think it's a discipline problem.

But 75-80% of ADHD and autistic children can't fall asleep easily.

That's not defiance. That's neurology.

Different brains need different tools.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

"Just be consistent" is terrible advice for parents of neurodivergent children.

Consistency in SEQUENCE isn't enough. ND children need consistency in every sensory detail.

One late dinner? The whole system resets.

### Tweet C (List)
5 things neurodivergent children experience at bedtime that you don't:

• Racing thoughts that won't stop
• Transition anxiety (7+ transitions in 60 minutes)
• Sensory overload from the entire day catching up
• Overtiredness triggering hyperactivity (not sleep)
• Melatonin patterns that don't match the clock

Which one does your child struggle with most?

### Tweet D (Contrarian)
The ADHD brain is under-stimulated during the day, then comes ALIVE at night when the world gets quiet.

That's why your exhausted child at 6pm is wired at 10pm.

Their brain is finally getting the quiet it needs to think.

Silence isn't calming—it's the problem.

### Tweet E (Question)
Parents of neurodivergent children:

What's your biggest bedtime struggle?

A) Won't fall asleep (racing thoughts)
B) Bedtime anxiety (resists going to bed)
C) Sensory issues (can't get comfortable)
D) Stays awake for hours after lights out
