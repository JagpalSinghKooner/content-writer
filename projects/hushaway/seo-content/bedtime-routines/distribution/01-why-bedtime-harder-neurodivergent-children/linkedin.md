# LinkedIn Content: Why Bedtime is Harder for Neurodivergent Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
**Bedtime isn't a discipline problem.**

**It's a neurology problem.**

Up to 80% of autistic children + 75% of ADHD children struggle at bedtime.

### Slide 2: What Everyone Gets Wrong
**The advice that doesn't work:**

"Just be consistent"
"Create a calming routine"
"Make sure they're tired enough"

You've tried all of it.

Still doesn't work.

Here's why.

---

### Slide 3: The ADHD Brain Won't Switch Off
Racing thoughts don't respond to "just close your eyes."

The ADHD brain is under-stimulated during the day, then comes alive when the world gets quiet.

No structure. No distractions.

Just a brain with nothing to focus on except every thought since breakfast.

---

### Slide 4: The Autistic Brain Craves Predictability
Bedtime looks like routine.

But it's actually 7+ transitions in under an hour:

• Leaving dinner
• Walking upstairs
• Running a bath
• Choosing pyjamas
• Brushing teeth
• Getting into bed
• Lights off, door closed

Each one a potential anxiety trigger.

---

### Slide 5: Overtiredness Triggers Hyperactivity
Exhaustion doesn't always lead to sleep for ND children.

Their nervous systems compensate for tiredness by ramping UP, not down.

The paradox you've seen 100 times:

The exhausted child who can't stop bouncing off the walls.

---

### Slide 6: Sensory Sensitivities You Can't See
Your bedroom is quiet.

Their bedroom is chaos.

• Humming electronics
• Sheet textures
• Pyjama pressure
• Streetlights through curtains
• Temperature differences
• That one floorboard creak

Every single one demands attention.

---

### Slide 7: Circadian Rhythm Differences
Research suggests many ND children have atypical melatonin patterns.

Their body clock runs on a different schedule.

An 8pm bedtime might feel like 6pm for neurotypical peers.

You're not fighting defiance.

You're fighting biology.

---

### Slide 8: What Actually Helps
**Predictability beyond routine**
Same sounds. Same lighting. Same words at the same moment.

**Something for the brain to land on**
Silence is the enemy. Passive sound gives racing thoughts an anchor.

**Sensory-aware environments**
Trust what your child tells you bothers them.

**Longer wind-down periods**
ND children often need 60+ minutes, not 30.

---

### Slide 9: Remove the Guilt
Neurodivergent bedtime struggles aren't created by permissive parenting.

They're not fixed by stricter parenting.

They exist because your child's brain processes transitions, sensory input, and arousal differently.

You're not failing.

You're parenting a child whose neurology requires different tools.

It's 9:47pm. Your child is wide awake.

You've done everything the books say. Star charts. Earlier bedtimes. Screens off at 6pm. Warm milk. Lavender spray. Weighted blankets. A routine so rigid you could set a clock by it.

And still. Every. Single. Night.

Here's what the parenting books don't tell you:

Your child isn't being defiant. They're not testing boundaries. They're not "just overtired."

Their brain works differently. And that difference doesn't clock off when the lights go down.

Neurodivergent bedtime struggles affect up to 80% of autistic children and 75% of children with ADHD. That's not a discipline problem. That's neurology.

**The ADHD brain won't switch off.** Racing thoughts don't respond to "just close your eyes." The ADHD brain is often under-stimulated during the day, then comes alive at night when the world finally gets quiet. No more distractions. No more structure. Just a brain with nothing to focus on except every thought it pushed aside since breakfast.

**The autistic brain craves predictability, but bedtime is chaos disguised as routine.** Think about what bedtime actually involves: leaving dinner, walking upstairs, running a bath, choosing pyjamas, brushing teeth, getting into bed, lights off, door closed, alone in the dark. That's at least seven transitions in under an hour. Each one a potential anxiety trigger.

If you've been blaming yourself, please stop. Right now.

You're not failing because star charts don't work. You're parenting a child whose neurology requires different tools. Tools that weren't in the parenting books because those books weren't written for your child.

What works is understanding why bedtime is hard, then finding approaches that match your child's actual brain.

"Just be consistent" is the advice parents of neurodivergent children hear most.

And it's the advice that misses the point entirely.

I've worked with hundreds of families whose children struggle at bedtime. Every single parent has tried consistency. Rigid routines. The same steps, same time, every night.

Still doesn't work. Here's why:

**Consistency assumes the routine will eventually become automatic.** For children with ADHD, automaticity is harder to achieve. Their brains need more repetitions, more cues, more external signals. And if anything disrupts the routine? One late dinner. One school event. One holiday. The whole system resets.

**Consistency assumes your child finds the same things calming that other children do.** But sensory processing differences flip this on its head. The ticking clock that helps neurotypical children track time passing? It might be the only thing your child can hear. The dim lamp that signals "wind-down"? It might feel like shadows are creeping closer.

What calms one child overwhelms another. There's no universal calm.

**Consistency assumes tiredness leads to sleep.** For many neurodivergent children, the opposite happens. Overtiredness triggers hyperactivity. Their nervous system compensates for exhaustion by ramping up, creating the paradox you've seen a hundred times: the exhausted child who can't stop bouncing off the walls.

So what actually works?

**Predictability beyond routine.** Neurodivergent children often need consistency in the sensory experience of each step, not just the sequence. The same sounds. The same lighting. The same words at the same moment. Consistency in tiny details creates safety.

**Something for the brain to land on.** For children with racing thoughts, silence is the enemy. Their brain fills the quiet with thoughts. But passive sound gives the brain something to focus on without demanding anything back. No meditation instructions to follow. No breathing exercises to remember. Just sound that provides an anchor.

**Sensory-aware environments.** This might mean blackout curtains, specific sheet textures, or removing ticking clocks. It definitely means paying attention to what your child complains about, even when the complaint seems minor. If the pyjama tag bothers them, it really bothers them. Trust what they tell you.

The relatives who say "they just need boundaries" aren't dealing with what you're dealing with. They're not watching their child genuinely distressed night after night. They don't understand.

But you do. And understanding why bedtime is hard is the first step to finding tools that actually work.

Your bedroom is quiet.

Their bedroom is chaos.

This is what neurodivergent children experience at bedtime:

The hum of electronics (you've stopped noticing it; they can't)
The texture of sheets against skin
The pressure of pyjamas on arms and legs
Streetlights bleeding through curtain gaps
The temperature difference between blanket and exposed skin
That one floorboard creak from downstairs

For children with sensory processing differences, these aren't background details. They're active problems demanding attention. Every single one.

You can't fall asleep while your brain is tracking every creak, every shadow, every unexpected sensation.

Research from the National Autistic Society shows that between 50-80% of autistic children experience sleep difficulties, compared to around 20-30% of neurotypical children. More than double the rate.

And the Sleep Foundation reports that up to 75% of children with ADHD experience sleep problems. Three in four.

This isn't coincidence. It's neurology.

Here's what many parents don't realise: children experiencing sensory overload from their day may find bedtime especially challenging. Their nervous system is still processing hours of accumulated sensory input from school, activities, and home life.

Bedtime isn't rest. It's the first quiet moment where everything catches up.

So what helps?

**Create a sensory-aware environment:**
• Blackout curtains if light bothers them
• White noise or ambient sounds if silence feels too loud
• Specific textures for sheets and pyjamas (let them choose)
• Remove ticking clocks and humming electronics
• Temperature control (weighted blankets for some, lighter covers for others)

**Trust what your child tells you bothers them.** Even when the complaint seems minor. If the pyjama tag bothers them, it really bothers them. Cut it out.

**Give their brain something to land on.** For some children, gentle soundscapes or frequencies provide the sensory anchor their brain needs. Not meditation (that's active). Not instructions (that's demanding). Just passive sound that asks nothing in return.

The racing thoughts have somewhere to land instead of spiralling.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Sometimes finding that moment starts with understanding why the loud moments exist.
