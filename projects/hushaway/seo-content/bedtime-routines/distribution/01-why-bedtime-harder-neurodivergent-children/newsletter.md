# Newsletter Snippet: Why Bedtime is Harder for Neurodivergent Children

## Hook

It's 9:47pm. Your child is wide awake. You've tried everything the books recommend—star charts, earlier bedtimes, screens off at 6pm, weighted blankets, routines so rigid you could set a clock by them. And still. Every. Single. Night.

## Body

If this sounds familiar, here's what you need to know: your child isn't being defiant. They're not testing boundaries. Their brain works differently, and that difference doesn't clock off when the lights go down.

Up to 80% of autistic children and 75% of children with ADHD struggle at bedtime. That's not a discipline problem. That's neurology.

**The ADHD brain won't switch off.** Racing thoughts don't respond to "just close your eyes." The brain comes alive at night when the world gets quiet—no distractions, no structure, just every thought pushed aside since breakfast flooding back. **The autistic brain craves predictability, but bedtime is actually chaos.** Seven transitions in under an hour (leaving dinner, walking upstairs, bath, pyjamas, teeth, bed, lights off). Each one a potential anxiety trigger.

And here's the paradox that confuses everyone: overtiredness triggers hyperactivity in many neurodivergent children. Their nervous system compensates for exhaustion by ramping up, not down. The exhausted child who can't stop bouncing isn't choosing defiance—that's biology.

What actually helps? Predictability beyond routine (consistency in every sensory detail, not just sequence). Something for the brain to land on (passive sound gives racing thoughts an anchor without demanding anything back). Sensory-aware environments (trust what your child tells you bothers them, even when it seems minor). And longer wind-down periods—60+ minutes instead of 30.

## CTA

If you've been blaming yourself, please stop. You're not failing. You're parenting a child whose neurology requires different tools—tools the parenting books didn't include because they weren't written for your child.
