# Newsletter Snippet: Neurodivergent Bedtime Routine - Complete Guide

## Hook

It's 10:17pm. You've been at this for two hours. Bath, pyjamas, teeth, story. Every step completed exactly as the books demand. And still your child is wide awake.

## Body

You haven't failed. You've done everything right.

Here's what nobody told you: structure alone isn't enough. Every expert explains the routine sequence in detail. Bath. Story. Lights out. Visual schedules get templates and implementation guides. Weighted blankets get specific recommendations.

But sound? "Try calming music." One line. Then nothing.

Sound isn't optional for neurodivergent bedtime routines. It's the mechanism that makes everything else work. For the ADHD brain that can't switch off, sound provides an anchor without demanding attention. For the autistic brain processing every transition, sound provides predictable sameness. For the anxious child afraid of being alone, sound stays present when you leave the room.

Our complete guide breaks down WHAT sounds to use, WHEN to play them, and WHY they work for different neurodivergent brains. The framework combines structure, visual supports, and sound into layers that support instead of demand. Plus the 4-week implementation plan that works with your reality, not against it.

## CTA

The routine charts and blackout blinds aren't failing you. The missing piece might be sound designed for neurodivergent brains.

**This week:** The element nobody talks about in neurodivergent bedtime routines

Every UK resource mentions sound. Usually one line: "Try calming music." Then nothing.

But sound isn't background noise for neurodivergent children. It's a primary regulation tool. And it deserves the same detailed guidance as visual schedules and weighted blankets.

Our pillar guide covers:
• Why sound works when other strategies don't (passive listening changes everything)
• What to play for ADHD, autism, and anxiety (specific sound types for specific brains)
• When to play sounds throughout the routine (bath to overnight)
• The 3-layer framework (structure + visuals + sound working together)
• Your 4-week implementation plan (realistic, tested, effective)

Between 50-80% of neurodivergent children struggle with sleep. You haven't failed. Different brains need different tools.
