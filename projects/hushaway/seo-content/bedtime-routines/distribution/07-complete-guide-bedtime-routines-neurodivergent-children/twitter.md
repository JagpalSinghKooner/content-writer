# Twitter/X Content: Neurodivergent Bedtime Routine - Complete Guide

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Every parenting resource tells you the structure for neurodivergent bedtime routines.

What nobody tells you is the element that makes it work.

Here's what's been missing 🧵

### Tweet 2
Browse any UK resource on neurodivergent sleep:
• National Autistic Society
• NHS trusts
• Sleep charities
• Specialist clinics

They all mention sound. Usually one line: "Try calming music."

Then nothing.

### Tweet 3
No guidance on WHAT sounds.
No explanation of WHEN to use them.
No understanding of WHY some help while others make things worse.

Sound deserves the same detailed guidance as visual schedules and weighted blankets.

### Tweet 4
Because sound isn't background noise for neurodivergent children.

It's a primary regulation tool.

Most bedtime strategies require something from exhausted children. Sound requires nothing. Just press play.

### Tweet 5
For the ADHD brain:

Racing thoughts don't respond to "just close your eyes."

Sound gives the brain something to land on. Without demanding active attention. Without requiring one more thing done perfectly.

### Tweet 6
For the autistic brain:

Bedtime involves 7+ transitions in under an hour. Each one could be different from yesterday.

Sound provides sameness. The same auditory input every night. One less variable to process.

### Tweet 7
For the anxious child:

The moment you leave the room is when everything falls apart.

Sound stays when you leave. Consistent. Patient. Present all night. It bridges the gap between "parent is here" and "I'm alone."

### Tweet 8
The framework that works:

Layer 1: Structure (same sequence every night)
Layer 2: Visual supports (make structure visible)
Layer 3: Sound (regulation without demands)

Together, they work. Alone, they struggle.

### Tweet 9
What to play:

Sleep onset: Pink noise, ASMR soundscapes, nature sounds without surprises

Staying asleep: Looped sounds with no endpoints

Racing thoughts: Complex enough to occupy, not stimulate

Sensory sensitivities: Softer textures, no high frequencies

### Tweet 10
When to play:

Sound isn't just for lights-off. It weaves through the entire routine.

Bath time → gentle transition sounds
Getting ready → consistent background
Story time → soft ambient or silence
Lights out → sleep sounds
Overnight → looped until morning

### Tweet 11
Your 4-week plan:

Week 1: Structure (consistent sequence)
Week 2: Visual supports
Week 3: Layer in sound (start at lights-off)
Week 4+: Extend sound through earlier phases

Give each phase 3+ nights before judging. Neurodivergent brains need time.

### Tweet 12
Between 50-80% of neurodivergent children struggle with sleep.

This isn't a discipline problem. This is neurology.

Understanding WHY bedtime is different means you can stop blaming yourself and start using approaches that work.

### Tweet 13
You haven't failed.

The routine charts. The blackout blinds. The weighted blanket. The patience that should earn you a medal.

You've done everything right. Sound might be the piece that was missing.

### Tweet 14 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Sound = primary regulation tool
• Works for ADHD, autism, anxiety
• Layer with structure + visuals
• Requires nothing from exhausted children
• One element. Huge difference.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Contrarian)
Hot take:

"Try calming music" is the most unhelpful advice in neurodivergent bedtime resources.

No guidance on WHAT sounds. No explanation of WHEN. No understanding of WHY.

Sound deserves better. Your exhausted child deserves specificity.

### Tweet B (Statistic)
50-80% of neurodivergent children struggle with sleep.

Compare that to 20-30% of neurotypical children.

This isn't a discipline problem. This is neurology.

Different brains need different tools.

### Tweet C (Problem → Solution)
The ADHD brain at bedtime:

When the house goes quiet, racing thoughts have nothing to compete with.

The brain creates its own stimulation: worries, ideas, replays of lunch.

Sound provides external anchor. Gentle, consistent input. No demands. Just presence.

### Tweet D (Visual + Sound)
Visual schedule shows "story time."

Sound confirms the phase.

Your child's brain receives two signals instead of one.

This is how visual and auditory supports work better together than either alone.

### Tweet E (Parent Exhaustion)
Most bedtime strategies require something from you:

"Try deep breathing with me."
"Let's do the relaxation exercise."
"Remember to check your schedule."

Sound requires nothing. Just press play.

For exhausted children AND exhausted parents.
