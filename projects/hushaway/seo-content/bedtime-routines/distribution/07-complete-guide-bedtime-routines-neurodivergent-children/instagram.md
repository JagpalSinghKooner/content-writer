# Instagram Content: Neurodivergent Bedtime Routine - Complete Guide

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
EVERY EXPERT TOLD YOU THE STRUCTURE

NOBODY TOLD YOU WHAT MAKES IT WORK

[Bold text, high contrast - warm colours aligned with HushAway branding]

### Slide 2: The Missing Element
Sound isn't background noise for neurodivergent children

It's a PRIMARY REGULATION TOOL

Yet every resource gives it one line

### Slide 3: Why Structure Alone Fails
Bath ✓
Pyjamas ✓
Teeth ✓
Story ✓

Child still wide awake

Because structure without support = demands on exhausted children

### Slide 4: What Sound Does
Most strategies require something:
→ Visual schedules need processing
→ Breathing exercises need following
→ Weighted blankets need tolerance

SOUND REQUIRES NOTHING
Just press play

### Slide 5: For ADHD Brains
Racing thoughts don't respond to "just close your eyes"

Sound gives the brain something to land on

Without demanding attention

### Slide 6: For Autistic Brains
7+ transitions in under an hour

Each one could be different from yesterday

Sound provides SAMENESS

One less variable to process

### Slide 7: For Anxious Children
When you leave the room, the sound STAYS

Consistent
Patient
Present all night

Bridging the gap between "parent is here" and "I'm alone"

### Slide 8: The Framework
LAYER 1: Structure
Same sequence every night

LAYER 2: Visual supports
Make structure visible

LAYER 3: Sound
Regulation without demands

### Slide 9: What to Play
Sleep onset: Pink noise, ASMR, nature sounds

Staying asleep: Looped sounds, no endpoints

Racing thoughts: Complex enough to occupy, not stimulate

Sensory sensitive: Softer textures, no high frequencies

### Slide 10: CTA
You've tried everything else

The routine
The patience
The dim lights

SOUND might be what was missing

## Caption

It's 10:17pm. You've been at this for two hours.

Bath. Pyjamas. Teeth. Story. Every step completed exactly as the parenting books demand.

And still your child is wide awake.

.
.
.

You haven't failed.

Here's what nobody told you: structure alone isn't enough for neurodivergent bedtime routines.

The element that makes it work? Sound.

Not "try calming music" mentioned in passing. Sound as a primary regulation tool. With specific guidance on WHAT to play, WHEN to play it, and WHY it works for neurodivergent brains.

Why sound changes everything:

Most bedtime strategies require something from your child. Visual schedules need processing. Breathing exercises need following. Weighted blankets need sensory tolerance.

Sound requires nothing. Just press play.

For ADHD brains → Sound gives racing thoughts something to land on
For autistic brains → Sound provides predictable sameness
For anxious children → Sound stays present when parents leave

The framework: Structure + Visual supports + Sound

Browse any UK resource on neurodivergent bedtime. They explain structure in detail. They give visual schedule templates. Sound gets one line.

But sound deserves the same detailed guidance. Because passive listening works on the nervous system without asking anything in return.

For exhausted children. For exhausted parents. It's the only input that doesn't require one more thing done perfectly.

Between 50-80% of neurodivergent children struggle with sleep. This isn't a discipline problem. This is neurology.

You've done everything right. The routine charts. The blackout blinds. The weighted blanket. The lavender pillow spray.

The piece that was missing? Sound designed for neurodivergent brains.

Explore sounds created specifically for sensitive and neurodivergent children in The Open Sanctuary. No decisions at bedtime. Just press play.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Stop. If bedtime with your neurodivergent child is a battle, you need to hear this."

[Visual: Parent looking exhausted, clock showing late evening]

**[3-22 seconds: VALUE]**
"Every expert told you the structure. Bath, pyjamas, story, lights out.

What nobody told you? Sound.

Not 'try calming music' mentioned once. Sound as a PRIMARY regulation tool.

For ADHD brains that can't switch off - sound gives thoughts something to land on.

For autistic brains processing every transition - sound provides predictable sameness.

For anxious children afraid of being alone - sound stays when you leave.

Structure + Visual supports + Sound. That's the framework that works."

[Visual: Show the 3 layers visually - structure, visuals, sound waves]

**[22-30 seconds: CTA]**
"You haven't failed. Sound might be the piece that was missing.

Follow for more neurodivergent parenting support."
