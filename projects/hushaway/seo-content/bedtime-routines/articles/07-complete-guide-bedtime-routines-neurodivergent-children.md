# Neurodivergent Bedtime Routine: The Complete UK Parent's Guide to Sound, Structure, and Sleep

It's 10:17pm. You've been at this for two hours.

Bath. Done. Pyjamas. Done. Teeth. Done. Story. Done.

Every step of the routine completed exactly as the parenting books demand. Exactly as you did yesterday and the day before. Consistency. Patience. Boundaries.

And still your child is wide awake, anxious, wired, or all three at once.

You haven't failed.

You've done everything right. The routine charts. The blackout blinds. The weighted blanket. The lavender pillow spray. The meditation app that promised miracles. You've read the books, followed the sleep consultants, tried the "gradual retreat" method until you wanted to cry.

None of it worked the way they said it would.

If you're a UK parent searching for answers at this time of night, you've probably found the same advice everywhere: create a consistent routine, dim the lights, try calming music, stay patient.

That advice isn't wrong. It's just incomplete.

Every expert tells you the structure of a neurodivergent bedtime routine. Bath, pyjamas, story, lights out. What nobody tells you is the element that actually makes it work.

Sound.

Not "try calming music" mentioned in passing. Sound as a primary regulation tool. Sound with specific guidance: WHAT to play, WHEN to play it, and WHY it works for neurodivergent brains.

That's what this guide provides. The complete framework that brings together structure, visual supports, condition-specific strategies, and the sound element that turns bedtime from battle into something that actually works.

## The Element Nobody Talks About

Browse any UK resource on neurodivergent bedtime routines. The National Autistic Society. NHS trusts. Sleep charities. Specialist clinics.

They all mention sound somewhere. Usually one line: "Try calming music" or "Some children find white noise helpful."

And then nothing.

No guidance on WHAT sounds. No explanation of WHEN to use them. No understanding of WHY some sounds help while others make things worse.

Compare that to visual supports. Every resource explains them in detail. Templates, examples, step-by-step implementation. Or weighted blankets. You'll find specific weight recommendations, timing guidelines, safety considerations.

But sound? "Try calming music." Figure it out yourself.

This matters because sound isn't background noise for neurodivergent children. It's a primary regulation tool. It gives the racing ADHD brain something to land on. It provides the predictable input autistic children crave. It stays present when parents leave the room, easing separation anxiety.

Sound deserves the same detailed guidance as visual schedules and weighted blankets. That's what you'll find throughout this guide and our [sound-based bedtime routine](/sound-based-bedtime-routine-nd-children) article.

## Why Bedtime is Different for Neurodivergent Children

Here's something nobody said at the start: your child's brain works differently. Not worse. Differently.

Understanding why matters. Not to assign blame or add another thing to worry about. But because knowing what's actually happening in your child's brain helps you stop fighting it and start working with it.

According to the National Autistic Society, 2024: [Sleep and autism](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/physical-health/sleep), between 50-80% of autistic children experience sleep difficulties. For ADHD, the Sleep Foundation, 2024: [ADHD and Sleep Problems: How Are They Related?](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mental-health/adhd-and-sleep) reports up to 75% of children struggle with sleep. Compare that to 20-30% of neurotypical children.

These aren't discipline problems. This is neurology. And it's not your fault.

If you want the full explanation of what's happening in your child's brain at bedtime, our article on [why bedtime is harder for neurodivergent children](/why-bedtime-harder-neurodivergent-children) goes deep. But here's the short version:

**The ADHD brain won't switch off.** During the day, there are distractions, activities, demands. At night, when everything goes quiet, the ADHD brain finally has space to think. Every thought that was pushed aside since breakfast comes rushing back. Racing thoughts don't respond to "just close your eyes."

**The autistic brain craves predictability.** Bedtime involves at least seven transitions in under an hour: dinner to bath, bath to pyjamas, pyjamas to teeth, teeth to story, story to bed, lights on to off, parent present to alone. Each transition is a moment where something could be different from yesterday. Each one a potential anxiety trigger.

**Sensory systems don't clock off.** The scratch of cotton sheets. The distant sound of a neighbour's television. The smell of washing powder on pillows. For children with sensory processing differences, these aren't background details. They're active inputs that the brain must process. At bedtime, when other stimulation drops away, these sensory details become louder.

**Melatonin timing differs.** Research shows neurodivergent children often have delayed melatonin production. Their bodies signal "time to sleep" later than their neurotypical peers. Putting them to bed at 7pm when their brain doesn't release melatonin until 9pm creates frustration for everyone.

**Anxiety peaks in the dark.** Daytime provides distractions. At night, in a quiet dark room, anxious thoughts have nothing to compete with. Worries about tomorrow, replays of today, fears about the unknown. All amplified in silence.

This isn't about your parenting. It never was.

It's about neurology. And understanding that means you can finally stop applying neurotypical strategies to a neurodivergent brain. You can stop blaming yourself. You can start using approaches that actually work.

## Sound: The Missing Core Element

Here's what every other resource gets wrong: they treat sound as an afterthought. An optional extra. A nice-to-have.

Sound isn't optional for neurodivergent bedtime routines. It's the mechanism that makes everything else work.

### Why Sound Works When Other Strategies Don't

During bedtime struggles, your child's capacity is already depleted. Their brain has been working overtime all day. Their sensory system is overloaded. Their executive function is exhausted.

Most bedtime strategies require something from them:
- Visual schedules require processing and checking
- Breathing exercises require following instructions
- Relaxation techniques require cognitive engagement
- Even weighted blankets require sensory tolerance

Sound requires nothing. Just press play.

No interaction. No choices. No demands. No more "can you try deep breathing with me?" when they're already past the point of following instructions. Sound works on the nervous system without asking anything in return.

This is what we call passive listening. And for exhausted or overwhelmed children, passive input is the only input that gets through.

For exhausted parents? It's the only input that doesn't require you to do one more thing perfectly.

### The Science Behind Sound and Sleep

Research supports what exhausted parents observe: sound genuinely affects sleep physiology.

Messineo et al., 2017: [Broadband Sound Administration Improves Sleep Onset Latency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618824/) found that broadband sounds (like pink noise) reduced the time it took to fall asleep by 38% compared to silence. For children who take hours to settle, that's significant.

The mechanism is straightforward. Consistent sound gives the brain something to focus on without demanding active attention. It masks environmental noises that cause alertness spikes. It provides predictable input that signals "everything is stable, it's safe to let go."

For ADHD brains, sound gives racing thoughts something to land on. The brain can't create anxious spirals when it's gently anchored to consistent audio.

For autistic brains, sound provides the sameness that reduces anxiety. When the auditory input is identical every night, one fewer variable can go wrong.

### What to Play: The Specificity You've Been Missing

"Try calming music" fails because it doesn't tell you anything useful. Here's what actually matters:

**For sleep onset (getting to sleep):**
- Pink noise or brown noise (deeper than white noise, less harsh)
- Slow ASMR soundscapes (repetitive, no surprises)
- Nature sounds WITHOUT sudden changes (steady rain, not thunderstorms)
- Solfeggio frequencies designed for relaxation

**For staying asleep:**
- Looped sounds that don't end (silence wakes them)
- Consistent volume throughout
- No dynamic shifts or tempo changes

**For racing thoughts:**
- Sounds complex enough to occupy attention but not enough to stimulate
- Layered ambient textures
- Binaural beats for some children (trial needed)

**For sensory sensitivities:**
- Softer sounds (ASMR often works better than louder white noise)
- Sounds designed without high frequencies that cause alertness
- Options without sudden elements (drops, birds, mechanical sounds)

Our complete [sound-based bedtime routine](/sound-based-bedtime-routine-nd-children) guide provides detailed protocols for each stage of bedtime, including volume guidance, timing, and what to do when specific sounds don't work.

And if you want to try tonight? The Open Sanctuary has sounds designed specifically for neurodivergent children. No subscription required to start exploring.

### When to Play: Sound Throughout the Routine

Sound isn't just for the lights-off moment. It's woven through the entire bedtime routine.

**Bath time:** Gentle, upbeat sounds that signal the transition from day to evening. Not silence, not screens, just sound that bridges the gap.

**Getting ready:** Consistent background sounds while brushing teeth and changing. This reduces the number of "things changing" the brain must process.

**Story time:** Either no additional sound, or very soft ambient sounds under your voice. This signals that sleep time is approaching.

**Lights out:** The main event. Sounds specifically designed for sleep onset. Played at the volume your child prefers (often quieter than parents expect).

**Overnight:** Looped sounds that continue until morning. No playlist endings at 2am to snap them awake.

The exact timing varies by child. Some need sound from the moment they leave dinner. Others only need it for lights-out. Start broader and narrow down based on what works.

## Building a Neurodivergent Bedtime Routine That Works

Structure matters. But structure alone isn't enough. What makes a neurodivergent bedtime routine work is combining structure with the right sensory inputs.

### The Framework: Structure + Sound + Visuals

Think of your bedtime routine as three layers:

**Layer 1: Structure.** The sequence of activities that happens every night in the same order. This provides predictability that reduces anxiety.

**Layer 2: Visual supports.** The picture schedules, now-and-next boards, or routine charts that let your child see what comes next. This makes the predictable structure visible and reduces "what happens now?" anxiety.

**Layer 3: Sound.** The auditory element that weaves through the structure, providing regulation support that visual schedules can't offer. Sound works on the nervous system while structure works on cognitive expectations.

Most resources give you Layer 1 and some guidance on Layer 2. Layer 3 gets one sentence. But Layer 3 is often the difference between a routine that works and one that doesn't.

### Creating Your Routine Structure

Every family's routine will differ. But the principles stay constant:

**Keep it consistent.** Same order, same timing, same parent when possible. We know this is hard. Life happens. Grandparents visit. One parent works late. But neurodivergent brains don't cope well with "we'll skip the bath tonight" or "let's read in the living room for a change." Do your best. Aim for consistent, not perfect.

**Keep it short enough to complete.** An ambitious 90-minute routine that falls apart at minute 45 is worse than a realistic 40-minute routine completed every night. We've all been there: the Pinterest-perfect routine that looked beautiful on paper and lasted exactly three days. Start shorter. Add elements later if needed.

**Build in transition warnings.** Two minutes before each activity change, give a verbal cue. "Teeth time in two minutes." This prevents the abrupt transitions that trigger resistance.

**End with presence, then sound.** The final element should be parent presence transitioning to sound presence. You leave the room. The sound stays.

A sample framework:

1. Bath (15 minutes, gentle sound playing)
2. Two-minute warning, then pyjamas (5 minutes)
3. Teeth (5 minutes)
4. Two-minute warning, then bedroom
5. Story (10 minutes, soft ambient under your voice or silence)
6. Goodnight ritual (consistent phrase or action)
7. Lights off, sleep sounds on
8. Parent leaves, sound continues

Total time: approximately 45 minutes. Adjust based on your child and your reality.

## Visual Supports: Structure Your Child Can See

Visual schedules do something important: they make the invisible visible.

For children who struggle with uncertainty, seeing what comes next reduces anxiety. For children who struggle with transitions, having a checkpoint to complete gives the change a purpose. For children who struggle with time, pictures ground the sequence in something concrete.

Our detailed guide on [visual bedtime routine](/visual-bedtime-routine-neurodivergent-children) covers templates and implementation. Here's the overview:

### Types of Visual Supports

**Picture schedules:** A sequence of images showing each step of the routine. Bath, pyjamas, teeth, story, bed. Simple, clear, in order.

**Now-and-next boards:** Shows only two things: what's happening now and what happens next. Less overwhelming for children who can't process a full schedule.

**First-then boards:** Similar to now-and-next but framed as "first we do X, then we can do Y." Useful when Y is something motivating.

**Routine charts with removable pieces:** Velcro or magnetic pieces that children physically move to a "done" section. Adds a satisfying completion action to each step.

### Visual + Sound Integration

Here's what most resources miss: visual and auditory supports work better together than either alone.

**Visual shows the structure.** Picture says "story time."

**Sound confirms the phase.** Soft ambient sounds play during story time, then shift to sleep sounds when story ends.

The combination gives your child's brain two consistent signals. They see what's happening. They hear what's happening. Prediction from two senses instead of one.

Implementation example:
- Bath picture + gentle upbeat sounds
- Pyjamas picture + same sounds continuing
- Teeth picture + sounds continuing
- Story picture + sounds lower or off
- Bed picture + sleep sounds begin

Each picture matches a sound phase. The brain receives consistency from multiple inputs.

## ADHD Bedtime: When the Brain Won't Switch Off

ADHD creates specific bedtime challenges that require specific strategies. Generic advice often makes things worse because it doesn't account for how the ADHD brain works.

If your child has ADHD and bedtime involves hours of "just one more thing" followed by wide-awake-at-midnight, our [ADHD bedtime routine](/sound-anchored-adhd-bedtime-routine) guide goes deep. Here's the core framework:

### Why Quiet Makes It Worse

You'd think quiet would help sleep. It makes intuitive sense. Calm environment. Peaceful child.

But for ADHD brains? Quiet is the enemy.

The ADHD brain is often under-stimulated during the day. External demands provide structure. Distractions keep thoughts from spiralling.

At bedtime, when the house goes quiet and the room goes dark, the ADHD brain suddenly has nothing to focus on. And an unfocused ADHD brain doesn't rest. It races.

This explains why silence backfires. For ADHD, quiet means nothing for the brain to land on. So it creates its own stimulation: thoughts, worries, ideas, replays of the embarrassing thing they said at lunch, plans for inventions, questions about space.

Sound provides something external. An anchor. The brain doesn't need to create its own stimulation when there's gentle, consistent input from outside.

### ADHD-Specific Sound Strategy

For ADHD brains at bedtime:

**Complexity matters.** Too simple (like basic white noise) may not occupy enough attention. Too complex (like music with lyrics) creates more stimulation. The sweet spot: layered ambient sounds, gentle ASMR textures, nature soundscapes with consistent patterns.

**Volume matters.** Loud enough to hear without straining. Quiet enough that it fades when sleep approaches. Start at conversation volume and reduce over time if your child prefers.

**Continuity matters.** The ADHD brain notices changes. Sounds must loop without obvious restart points. Playlists that end at 2am will wake them.

### Managing "Revenge Bedtime Procrastination"

Have you ever stayed up too late scrolling your phone after a demanding day? That's "revenge bedtime procrastination." It means staying awake to reclaim personal time after a day with little control. Many ADHD children (and adults) experience exactly this. After a day with little control over their time, they resist sleep to reclaim autonomy.

Signs: Your child isn't anxious or struggling. They're defiantly awake, wanting to do something, anything, other than sleep.

If you've ever stayed up too late scrolling your phone after a demanding day, you understand this. It's not about the scrolling. It's about finally having time that belongs to you.

This isn't defiance for defiance's sake. It's a genuine need for self-directed time.

Solutions:
- Build autonomous time INTO the routine (they choose the story, they choose the sounds)
- Acknowledge the feeling without arguing ("I know you want more time. We all feel that sometimes.")
- Use sound as the boundary ("When the sleep sounds start, it's sleep time. The sounds are in charge now, not me.")

The last point matters. Making the sound the authority removes parent-child conflict. It's not you versus them. It's all of you following what the routine says.

## Autism Bedtime: Predictability Creates Calm

Autistic children often need something different from ADHD strategies. Where ADHD struggles with an unfocused brain, autism often struggles with unpredictability and transition.

Our complete [autism bedtime routine](/autism-bedtime-routine-predictability-calm) guide covers this in depth. Here's the framework:

### Why Sameness Matters

Your child isn't being rigid or difficult. Their brain is doing exactly what it's designed to do: notice everything.

The autistic brain processes change as potential threat. Not consciously. Not dramatically. Just a small spike of alertness with each transition, each variation, each "not-quite-the-same-as-yesterday."

Bedtime involves many transitions. Each one is an opportunity for something to be different. Different towel. Different pyjama texture. Different story position. Different goodbye phrase.

You might not notice these things. Your child does. Their brain catalogues every change, cross-references it against expectations, and decides whether it's safe. Neurotypical brains filter these variations out automatically. Autistic brains notice them all. And noticing requires processing. And processing at bedtime means staying alert when the goal is relaxation.

Predictability reduces the number of things requiring processing. When everything is the same as yesterday, the brain can finally rest.

### Autism-Specific Sound Strategy

Sound supports autistic bedtime in a particular way: it provides predictable, consistent sensory input.

**Sameness is the point.** The same sounds, every night, at the same point in the routine, at the same volume. This isn't boring. This is exactly right. What looks like inflexibility is actually the brain seeking safety. The autistic brain finds comfort in predictability, not novelty.

**Sensory profile matters.** Some autistic children have heightened sound sensitivity. For them, softer ASMR textures work better than louder white noise. Others seek auditory input and prefer fuller sounds. Match the sound type to your child's sensory preferences, not generic recommendations.

**Sound as transition signal.** Each routine phase can have a distinct sound "signature." Bath phase sounds. Story phase sounds. Sleep phase sounds. The sound change signals the transition before you announce it, giving the brain advance notice.

**Sound as parent replacement.** Many autistic children struggle with separation at bedtime. The gradual retreat method (slowly reducing parent presence over weeks) works for some. Sound makes it gentler. You leave. The sound stays. There's still consistent sensory presence even when you're not physically there.

### Supporting Transitions

Transitions are where autism bedtime routines often break down. Here's how to smooth them:

**Verbal warnings aren't enough.** Two-minute warnings help, but the autistic brain may not process time verbally. Pair warnings with visual (pointing to the schedule) and auditory (a specific sound or phrase that always precedes transitions) cues.

**Make the transition visible.** Move the visual schedule piece. Change the sound. Turn off the bathroom light. Physical environmental changes confirm "yes, this phase is really over."

**Allow processing time.** After announcing a transition, give space. Your child may need 30 seconds of apparent non-compliance that's actually processing time. It can look like ignoring you. It's not. Their brain is working. Don't rush it.

## Bedtime Anxiety: Sound Stays When You Leave

For children with bedtime anxiety, the moment you leave the room is the moment everything falls apart. All the routine, all the calm, all the settling. Gone the instant the door closes.

You've been there. The creeping backwards towards the door. The hand on the handle. The little voice: "Don't go."

Our guide on [bedtime anxiety](/bedtime-anxiety-sound-calm-answer) covers the full approach. Here's the core principle:

### Why Sound Bridges the Gap

Bedtime anxiety often stems from the absence of parental presence. Not attention-seeking, no matter what well-meaning relatives suggest. Genuine fear of being alone.

Traditional approaches either:
- Keep parents present indefinitely (unsustainable)
- Remove parents abruptly (traumatic for anxious children)
- Use gradual retreat (effective but slow)

Sound offers something different: presence without physical presence.

When you leave the room, the sound stays. It's consistent. It doesn't get tired or frustrated. It doesn't gradually move towards the door. It remains, unchanged, all night.

For anxious children, sound becomes the companion that bridges the gap between "parent is here" and "I'm alone."

### Implementing Sound for Anxiety

**Start with sound while you're still present.** Don't introduce sound as a replacement. Introduce it as an addition. You AND the sound are here during story time. You AND the sound are here when the lights go out.

**Make sound part of the goodbye ritual.** "Goodnight. The sounds will keep you company. They'll be here all night." This frames sound as intentional presence, not absence of you.

**Ensure sounds don't stop.** Anxious children wake at sound changes. If your playlist ends at midnight, their brain registers the change and alerts for danger. Looped sounds without endpoints prevent this.

**Consider ASMR for anxious children.** ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) sounds often feel more "present" than white noise. Soft sounds, gentle textures, careful attention. For some anxious children, ASMR feels like someone is there with them in a way that mechanical noise doesn't.

### The Gradual Retreat Made Gentler

Many sleep consultants recommend gradual retreat: sitting further from the bed each night until you're outside the room. This works, but it's hard on anxious children.

Sound makes it gentler:

Week 1: Sit beside the bed, sound playing, until sleep.
Week 2: Sit beside the bed until drowsy, then move to a chair. Sound continues.
Week 3: Start in the chair. Sound continues.
Week 4: Sit by the door. Sound continues.
Week 5: Stand at the door, leave when drowsy. Sound continues.

At each stage, the sound remains constant. Your position changes, but the auditory presence doesn't. The transition from "parent present" to "alone" has a constant companion throughout.

## Putting It All Together: Your Implementation Framework

Theory is useful. Implementation is what changes bedtime. Here's how to take everything above and turn it into action:

### Week 1: Establish the Structure

Before adding anything new, nail down your routine structure:

1. Write down your current bedtime routine exactly as it happens
2. Identify the pain points (where does it break down?)
3. Design a simple routine with consistent steps
4. Implement consistent timing for one week
5. Don't add visual supports or new sounds yet

Goal: Establish that this is the routine, every night, no exceptions.

### Week 2: Add Visual Supports

Once the structure is consistent:

1. Create a simple visual schedule (pictures, photos, or drawings)
2. Introduce it to your child during the day, not at bedtime
3. Walk through the schedule together, explaining each step
4. Use the schedule that night, pointing to each step as you do it
5. Don't add sound changes yet

Goal: Make the routine visible so your child knows what comes next.

### Week 3: Layer in Sound

Now add the sound element:

1. Choose sounds based on your child's needs:
   - **Racing thoughts (ADHD):** Layered ambient sounds or gentle ASMR textures that give the brain something to land on
   - **Anxiety:** Consistent, predictable sounds like pink noise or nature soundscapes without sudden changes
   - **Sensory preferences:** Some children prefer minimal sounds (soft ambient), others need more texture (layered ASMR)
   - **Transition struggles (autism):** Predictable, repeating sounds that signal "this is sleep time now"
2. Start with sound only at the lights-off moment
3. Play at a comfortable volume, then ask your child if it should be louder or quieter
4. Observe what happens. Sleep faster? Calmer? Or more alert?
5. Adjust sound type if needed (try different options from The Open Sanctuary)

Goal: Find sounds that help rather than hinder, then make them consistent.

### Week 4 and Beyond: Refine and Extend

Once you have working sounds at lights-off:

1. Consider extending sound to earlier parts of the routine (bath time, getting ready)
2. Match sound types to routine phases (upbeat for getting ready, calm for story, sleep sounds for bed)
3. Create the auditory "signature" for each transition
4. Note what works and what doesn't
5. Give changes at least three nights before judging. Neurodivergent brains need time to accept new patterns.

Goal: A complete routine where structure, visuals, and sound work together.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"My child wants the sound louder/quieter every night."**
This may be sensory seeking or avoidance that changes with daily regulation. Allow some flexibility in volume while keeping the sound itself consistent.

**"The sounds made my child more alert."**
Wrong sound type for your child. Try softer options (ASMR instead of white noise), or different content (nature sounds instead of frequencies). Not every sound works for every child.

**"My child won't keep headphones on."**
Don't use headphones. Play sound through a speaker in the room. Many children find headphones uncomfortable, especially those with sensory sensitivities.

**"The routine worked for a week, then stopped."**
Normal. Neurodivergent brains sometimes reject change initially, accept it, then reject it again. Stay consistent. It usually stabilises within 3-4 weeks.

**"My child says the sounds are annoying."**
Sometimes true. Sometimes resistance to change. Try: "Let's give it one more week. If you still don't like it, we'll try different sounds." Often they adapt. If not, try different sounds.

## Where to Find the Right Sounds

We've talked about WHAT sounds help and WHEN to use them. But where do you actually find sounds designed for neurodivergent bedtime?

Most "calming sounds" weren't made for your child. They were made for neurotypical adults and marketed to everyone. The sudden bird call in the nature sounds. The unexpected tempo change in the "relaxation" track. The playlist that ends at 2am, waking your finally-sleeping child.

The Open Sanctuary is different. Every sound was created specifically for sensitive and neurodivergent children. Not adapted. Built from the ground up for brains that work differently.

Inside, you'll find:
- Night time stories with consistent, predictable formats
- ASMR soundscapes designed without sensory triggers
- Frequencies and ambient sounds for different regulation needs
- Options organised by use case (sleep onset, staying asleep, anxiety, racing thoughts)

No decisions at bedtime. No scrolling through options trying to find something that works while your child gets more wound up. Just press play.

**Explore The Open Sanctuary and try a sound tonight.** Because you've already tried everything else. This might be the piece that was missing.

## FAQ

### How long should a neurodivergent bedtime routine take?

Most successful routines run 30-60 minutes from start (leaving dinner/screens) to finish (lights out). Shorter than 30 minutes often feels rushed. Longer than 60 minutes often loses momentum. Start around 45 minutes and adjust based on what your child needs.

### What if my child has both ADHD and autism?

Many children have both. Use strategies from both sections, prioritising based on which challenges are more prominent at bedtime. If racing thoughts are the main issue, lean towards ADHD strategies. If transition anxiety is primary, lean towards autism strategies. Sound helps both, just in slightly different ways.

### Should I use the same sounds every night?

Yes. Consistency is part of what makes sound effective. The brain learns to associate those specific sounds with sleep time. Changing sounds nightly introduces novelty that neurodivergent brains then need to process.

### What volume should bedtime sounds be played at?

Quiet enough to become background, loud enough to hear without straining. Most children prefer quieter than parents expect. Start at low-medium volume and ask your child for feedback. The NHS, 2024: [Other conditions that may affect autistic people](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/other-conditions/) notes that sensory sensitivities are common in autism, so sound volume matters.

### How long before I'll see results?

Some children respond immediately. Others need 2-3 weeks of consistent use before the brain accepts the new pattern. Don't judge a sound or routine after one night. Give it at least a week with consistent implementation.

### My child is a teenager. Is this guide still relevant?

Yes. The principles apply across ages: structure, predictability, and sound as regulation support. Teenagers may have input on sound choices (and should). The framework adapts; the core approach remains.

### What if my partner does bedtime differently?

Consistency matters more than perfection. The same basic structure and sounds should apply regardless of which parent is present. Agree on the essentials (order of activities, which sounds, how lights-out works) and allow small variations in delivery. The auditory routine especially should stay constant.

## You Haven't Failed

One more thing before you go.

If you're reading this at 11pm while your child is still awake, you're a good parent. If you've tried dozens of approaches and none of them worked perfectly, you're a good parent. If some nights are better than others and you can't figure out why, you're still a good parent.

Bedtime with a neurodivergent child is genuinely harder. The statistics prove it. Between 50-80% of neurodivergent children struggle with sleep, compared to 20-30% of neurotypical children. You're not imagining the difficulty. You're not doing it wrong.

You just need different tools. Tools designed for the brain your child actually has, not the brain the parenting books assume.

Sound might be that tool. It's worked for thousands of families. It might work for yours.

**Try a sound from The Open Sanctuary tonight.** Not because it's guaranteed to fix everything. But because after all you've tried, you deserve something that works with your child's brain instead of against it.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.
