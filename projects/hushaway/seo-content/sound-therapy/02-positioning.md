# Positioning: Sound Therapy for Children

## Market Analysis

**Market Sophistication:** Stage 3 (The Mechanism Introducer)

This market shows clear Stage 3 signals:
- Multiple competitors making similar promises ("helps with regulation," "supports autism," "calming sounds")
- Parent skepticism is high—they've tried apps, consultants, clinic programmes
- "I've tried things like this before" objection is common
- Competitors all sound the same; claims are undifferentiated

**The winning approach at Stage 3:** Introduce the mechanism—the unique HOW that explains why this works when other things haven't.

**HushAway's primary mechanism:** Evidence Transparency—being the ONLY resource that honestly discusses what research supports (and what it doesn't). This is the "Unspoken Mechanism" type: competitors have access to the same evidence, but nobody talks about it. HushAway claims this territory by speaking first.

**Secondary mechanism:** Passive Listening—a distinct category from active engagement approaches. No demands, no interaction, just press play. This addresses why previous "solutions" failed (they required engagement from overwhelmed children and exhausted parents).

## Primary Angle (Pillar Guide)

**Article:** Complete Guide to Sound Therapy for Children
**Target keyword:** sound therapy for children uk, sound therapy for children

**The angle:** While everyone else tells you what sound therapy CAN do, we're the only resource telling you what it actually DOES—with the evidence to prove it (and the honesty to admit what's unproven).

**Why it works:** Every competitor makes claims. No competitor assesses evidence. Parents increasingly research claims independently before committing time and money. The first resource to be transparent about evidence wins long-term trust. This is contrarian positioning that builds authority precisely because it risks admitting limitations.

**Headline direction:** "Sound Therapy for Children: What Actually Works (And What the Research Really Says)"

**This angle claims:** Truth through transparency—the only guide that gives you evidence, not just promises
**This angle rejects:** The claims-heavy approach that treats all sound therapies as equally valid and every benefit as proven

## Secondary Angles

### Article 1: Understanding Sound Therapy for Children (Foundation)

**Target keyword:** sound therapy autism, auditory therapy kids

**The angle:** Most resources assume you know what sound therapy IS. We start at the beginning—because understanding the different types is the first step to knowing which (if any) might help your child.

**Why it works:** Meets parents where they actually are: confused. The term "sound therapy" means different things to different people. This positions HushAway as the patient guide who doesn't skip the basics. Builds foundation for all other content.

**Headline direction:** "What Is Sound Therapy for Children? A Clear Guide for Confused Parents"

**Reinforces primary via:** Transparency starts with clarity—if we can't explain what it is, how can we claim what it does? Sets up the evidence discussion in Article 2.

---

### Article 2: Does Sound Therapy Work? The Evidence Explained

**Target keyword:** does sound therapy work, sound therapy evidence

**The angle:** The honest answer nobody else gives—because telling you some approaches lack evidence costs us nothing, but earns your trust.

**Why it works:** This is the heart of the evidence transparency mechanism. Every competitor avoids this article because it risks admitting limitations. HushAway leans into it. Parents Googling "does sound therapy work" are skeptical and research-minded—exactly the audience that responds to transparency.

**Headline direction:** "Does Sound Therapy Actually Work? The Evidence Parents Deserve to See"

**Reinforces primary via:** This IS the primary angle in pure form. The pillar guide summarises; this article goes deep. Specifically addresses Tomatis/AIT weak evidence (competitor vulnerability).

### Article 3: Binaural Beats for Children: A Parent's Guide

**Target keyword:** binaural beats children, binaural beats safe for children

**The angle:** The safety guide every parent searches for but nobody writes—because it requires admitting binaural beats aren't studied enough in children. We'll tell you what we know, what we don't, and how to use them sensibly.

**Why it works:** High search volume, massive UK content gap. Parents are searching "binaural beats safe for children" and finding nothing credible. The transparency mechanism works perfectly here: limited evidence, so be honest about that while providing practical guidance.

**Headline direction:** "Binaural Beats for Children: The Safety Guide Every Parent Needs"

**Reinforces primary via:** Applies evidence transparency to a specific modality. Demonstrates the mechanism pattern for parents who came in through this search.

### Article 4: Solfeggio Frequencies for Children: What Parents Should Know

**Target keyword:** solfeggio frequencies children, 528 hz benefits children

**The angle:** The evidence for solfeggio frequencies is thin—but that doesn't mean they're worthless. Here's how to think about traditional practices that haven't been formally studied.

**Why it works:** This angle is nuanced. Rather than dismissing solfeggio frequencies (alienating parents interested in them) or overclaiming (losing trust), it occupies the honest middle ground. "Evidence meets tradition" respects both perspectives while maintaining credibility.

**Headline direction:** "Solfeggio Frequencies for Children: What Research Shows (And Doesn't)"

**Reinforces primary via:** Evidence transparency applied to a modality with even less research. Shows consistency in approach—we don't cherry-pick which modalities to be honest about.

### Article 5: Sound Therapy at Home: A Parent's Guide (Conversion Driver)

**Target keyword:** sound therapy at home child, diy sound therapy

**The angle:** You don't need a practitioner, a clinic, or £500+ programmes. What you need is sound therapy you can do at home—and a guide that tells you exactly how.

**Why it works:** This is the "No Practitioner Required" angle that fills the gap left by SSP, Harley Row, and other service-based competitors. Highest commercial intent—parents searching this want to DO something. The angle removes barriers (cost, access, geographic limitations) and positions HushAway as the accessible alternative.

**Headline direction:** "Sound Therapy at Home: The Parent's Guide (No Practitioners Needed)"

**Reinforces primary via:** Extends evidence transparency to practical application. Now that you understand what works, here's how to do it yourself. Direct bridge to The Open Sanctuary.

### Article 6: Sound Therapy vs Music Therapy: What's the Difference?

**Target keyword:** sound therapy vs music therapy, difference sound therapy music therapy

**The angle:** They're not the same thing—and the difference matters more than you think. Passive listening vs active engagement isn't a small distinction; it's the reason one might work for your child when the other didn't.

**Why it works:** Addresses common confusion directly. Positions HushAway's passive listening approach as a distinct category, not a lesser version of music therapy. Parents who've tried music therapy and found it too demanding for their child now understand why sound therapy might work.

**Headline direction:** "Sound Therapy vs Music Therapy: The Critical Difference Parents Miss"

**Reinforces primary via:** Introduces the passive listening mechanism formally. Explains WHY this approach might work when others haven't—the core function of mechanism positioning at Stage 3.

## Consistency Check

**All angles share:** Transparency as the trust mechanism. Every article commits to telling the truth about evidence, limitations, and what we actually know vs. what we hope. This extends to practical honesty (you can do this at home) and category clarity (passive vs. active listening).

**Primary angle establishes:** Evidence transparency as HushAway's differentiator—the only resource that tells you what actually works and isn't afraid to admit what doesn't.

**Supporting angles extend via:**
- **Article 1 (Foundation):** Transparency starts with clarity—explaining what sound therapy is before claiming what it does
- **Article 2 (Evidence):** The deepest expression of the primary angle—the full evidence review
- **Article 3 (Binaural):** Evidence transparency applied to a specific modality parents search for
- **Article 4 (Solfeggio):** Evidence transparency extended to tradition-based practices with limited research
- **Article 5 (Home):** Practical transparency—here's what you can do yourself, no gatekeepers
- **Article 6 (Comparison):** Category transparency—explaining the mechanism (passive listening) that differentiates this approach

**Potential conflicts:**

1. **Article 4 (Solfeggio) risk:** Could feel like endorsing pseudoscience if framed wrong. Resolution: Lead with evidence limitations explicitly, then explain why parents find value despite limited studies. Frame as "cultural practice worth exploring" not "proven therapy."

2. **Article 5 (Home) risk:** Could undermine credibility by seeming anti-professional. Resolution: Position home-based sound therapy as complementary to professional support, not replacement. Acknowledge when professional help is needed (meltdown intensity, safety concerns, suspected hearing issues).

3. **Evidence transparency fatigue risk:** Constantly saying "evidence is limited" could feel negative. Resolution: Balance by highlighting what IS supported, practical parent experience, and HushAway's ND-first design advantages. Transparency builds trust, but hope keeps people engaged.

**Reader journey:**

A parent discovers this pillar through any entry point and encounters the same underlying message: *HushAway tells you the truth.*
