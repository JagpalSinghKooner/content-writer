You've searched this question before. Probably late at night, after another bedtime that left you exhausted. Or scrolling your phone while your child finally, mercifully, fell asleep.

Does sound therapy work? Really?

You're right to be sceptical. You've tried things that promised the world and delivered nothing. You've spent money on solutions that turned out to be expensive disappointments. Your trust has been earned, not given.

So here's what we're going to do: give you a straight answer. Not a sales pitch. Not vague promises. The actual evidence, including what it doesn't show.

Because you deserve to know whether sound therapy works before investing your time and energy. As parents ourselves, we've spent hours researching what the science actually says. This guide shares everything we've found.

## Why Honesty About Evidence Matters

Most websites selling sound therapy products won't tell you this: the evidence base is mixed. Some approaches have solid research behind them. Others have almost none.

That matters. You're an exhausted parent trying to help your child. You don't have time for things that don't work. And you definitely don't need another disappointment.

So let's be clear about [what sound therapy actually is](/understanding-sound-therapy-children) first. Then we'll look at what the research says about each type.

## Does Sound Therapy Work for Autism and ADHD?

The answer depends on which type you're asking about. Research quality varies wildly across [different types of sound therapy](/understanding-sound-therapy-children).

Here's the honest breakdown.

### Music Therapy: Strong Evidence

Good news first. Music therapy has the strongest evidence base of any sound-based approach for autistic children.

A Cochrane Review (the gold standard for medical evidence) analysed 26 studies involving over 1,000 autistic participants. Geretsegger et al., 2022: [Music therapy for people with autism spectrum disorder](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29232055/) found moderate to strong evidence that music therapy improves:

- Social interaction and communication
- Non-verbal communication skills
- Social adaptation
- Quality of parent-child relationships

The review noted that music therapy was more effective than standard care alone. Effects showed up after as few as one weekly session over several months.

One important point: music therapy typically requires a trained therapist and active participation from your child. It's different from [passive listening](/understanding-sound-therapy-children) approaches where you simply press play.

### The Safe and Sound Protocol: Emerging Evidence

The Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP) has generated genuine interest from researchers. It uses specially processed music to stimulate the vagus nerve and calm the nervous system, based on Polyvagal Theory.

Porges SW, 2022: [Polyvagal Theory and the Safe and Sound Protocol](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244024125894) provides the theoretical foundation. Early studies show promise for reducing anxiety and improving auditory processing.

Here's the catch: SSP requires practitioner delivery and typically costs several hundred pounds. The evidence is encouraging, but comes mostly from smaller studies. Larger trials are still needed.

### Binaural Beats: Limited but Interesting

Binaural beats work by playing slightly different frequencies in each ear. Your brain perceives a third frequency and may shift into different states: relaxation, focus, sleep.

The research is genuinely interesting. Beauchene et al., 2023: [The Effect of Binaural Beats on Visuospatial Working Memory and Cortical Connectivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10469527/) found that specific frequencies improved working memory and changed brain connectivity patterns.

Now for the honest part: most studies have been conducted on adults. Research specifically on children with autism or ADHD is limited. That doesn't mean binaural beats don't work for children. It means we can't point to large-scale studies proving they do.

What we can say: binaural beats are safe and non-invasive. Many parents report positive experiences. The lack of extensive paediatric research reflects funding priorities, not safety concerns.

### Auditory Integration Training and Tomatis: Weak Evidence

Here's where we diverge from most sound therapy providers. We have to be honest about Auditory Integration Training (AIT) and the Tomatis Method.

A Cochrane Review specifically examining these approaches found limited evidence of benefit. Sinha et al., 2024: [Auditory integration training and other sound therapies for autism spectrum disorder](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30084216/) concluded that high-quality studies showed no significant improvements compared to control groups.

These programmes typically cost between £1,200 and £2,000. Given the weak evidence, we can't recommend them with confidence.

Some parents do report positive experiences with AIT or Tomatis. Individual responses vary. Absence of evidence isn't the same as evidence of absence. But with limited funds and energy, you deserve to know the research doesn't strongly support these expensive programmes.

### Solfeggio Frequencies: Traditional Practice, Limited Research

Solfeggio frequencies (like the popular 528 Hz "healing frequency") have ancient roots and passionate advocates. But peer-reviewed research on their therapeutic effects for children? Minimal.

This doesn't make them worthless. Traditional practices often work through mechanisms science hasn't fully studied. Many parents find solfeggio frequencies calming for their children.

Our honest assessment: try them if you're curious. Just don't expect research-backed results. They're best viewed as calming background sound rather than therapeutic intervention.

## What the Evidence Actually Tells Us

After reviewing dozens of studies, here's what we've found.

**Approaches with solid evidence:**
- Music therapy (with a trained therapist)
- SSP (emerging evidence, practitioner-required)

**Approaches with promising but limited evidence:**
- Binaural beats (mostly adult studies)
- General calming soundscapes (intuitive but understudied)

**Approaches with weak evidence despite bold claims:**
- Auditory Integration Training (AIT)
- Tomatis Method
- Specific frequency "healing" claims

## Is Sound Therapy Effective for Daily Life?

Research studies measure specific outcomes. Your daily life involves something messier: getting through bedtime, managing after-school overwhelm, surviving car journeys.

Here's the thing.

Sound therapy doesn't need a published study to help your child settle. If calming sounds help your child fall asleep faster, that's valuable. It doesn't matter whether researchers have quantified it.

The question isn't just "does sound therapy work according to clinical trials?" It's also "does this specific sound help my specific child right now?"

Research tells us:
- Predictable, calming auditory input can reduce anxiety
- Passive listening requires nothing from exhausted children (or exhausted parents)
- Consistent routines with sound cues help with transitions
- Individual responses vary wildly

What research can't tell us is which sounds will resonate with your child. That requires trying things. Watching. Noticing.

## Sound Therapy Evidence: What Parents Report

Clinical trials capture one type of evidence. Parent experience captures another.

In our community, parents consistently tell us:
- Faster sleep onset with consistent sound routines
- Easier transitions between activities
- Calmer car journeys with background soundscapes
- Better recovery from meltdowns with low-stimulation audio
- Reduced morning stress with predictable wake-up sounds

These aren't peer-reviewed findings. They're real parents discovering what helps their families.

Both types of evidence matter. Research tells us what works on average across populations. Parent experience tells us what works for individual children in real homes.

## Red Flags: Warning Signs in Sound Therapy Claims

Not every sound therapy claim deserves your attention. Here's what to watch for.

**Cure claims.** Sound therapy supports regulation. It doesn't cure autism, ADHD, or any neurodevelopmental condition. Anyone claiming otherwise is misleading you.

**Expensive programmes with weak evidence.** If someone charges £1,500 for a programme and cites studies that don't actually support their claims, walk away.

**One-size-fits-all promises.** Your child is unique. No sound therapy works identically for everyone. Be suspicious of guaranteed results.

**Dismissing your experience.** If a provider insists their method works when you're seeing no improvement, trust yourself. Evidence includes what you observe in your own child.

## How to Think About Sound Therapy Evidence

Here's our framework for evaluating sound therapy claims.

**For clinical applications** (improving auditory processing, reducing anxiety symptoms), look for:
- Peer-reviewed studies
- Control groups
- Reasonable sample sizes
- Replication across multiple studies

**For daily life support** (bedtime, transitions, calm-down), look for:
- Safety information
- Age-appropriate design
- Parent community feedback
- Free trials before commitment

Research-backed approaches cost more and require practitioners. That's appropriate for therapeutic goals.

For daily regulation support? You don't need a prescription. You need something safe, affordable, and designed for children like yours.

## So Does Sound Therapy Work? Our Honest Answer

Sound therapy isn't one thing. It's dozens of approaches with wildly different evidence behind them.

Music therapy works. Solid research backs it up. The Safe and Sound Protocol shows promise but needs more study. Binaural beats are interesting but under-researched in children. Expensive auditory training programmes have weak evidence despite confident marketing.

What about daily calming sounds? They haven't been extensively studied because no one funds research into "playing gentle sounds at bedtime." But that doesn't mean they don't help real families every night.

Here's what we can tell you with confidence.

Sound therapy isn't magic. It won't cure anything. It probably won't transform your child overnight.

But the right sounds, used consistently, can become part of a regulation toolkit that genuinely helps. Many families find that predictable audio routines reduce bedtime battles, ease transitions, and support calmer moments.

That's not a research-backed claim. It's what we see every day in our community of parents finding what works for their children.

## What to Try First

If you're considering sound therapy for your child, here's where we'd start.

**Start simple.** Explore gentle soundscapes before committing to expensive programmes. See what resonates.

**Observe your child.** Notice which sounds they gravitate toward. Notice which make them uncomfortable. Your child is the expert on what helps them.

**Be patient.** Consistent use over weeks matters more than any single session. Give it time.

**Trust your judgement.** If something isn't working after a fair trial, move on. There's no shame in admitting an approach isn't right for your child.

**Consider your goals.** Clinical concerns (auditory processing difficulties, significant anxiety) may warrant practitioner involvement. Daily regulation support can often start at home.

The Open Sanctuary gives you a place to explore sounds designed specifically for neurodivergent children. No pressure. No false promises. Just sounds to try with your child tonight.

For a broader view of all the approaches covered here, see our [complete guide to sound therapy for children](/complete-guide-sound-therapy-children).

We'd rather you find what genuinely helps than buy something that doesn't.

Because the most honest answer to "does sound therapy work?" is this: some approaches do, some don't, and the only way to know what works for your child is to try.

## FAQ

### Does sound therapy have scientific evidence?

Yes, but evidence varies wildly by type. Music therapy has strong evidence from Cochrane Reviews. Binaural beats have promising adult studies but limited paediatric research. Auditory Integration Training and Tomatis have weak evidence despite high costs. The real question isn't whether sound therapy works, but which types have evidence for which outcomes.

### Is sound therapy safe for children?

Generally yes, when used appropriately. Passive listening approaches carry minimal risk. Binaural beats should be used at moderate volumes with proper stereo headphones. Any therapy claiming to "fix" your child or cure conditions should be viewed with scepticism. Loud volumes and excessive headphone use can affect hearing regardless of sound type.

### Why do some parents say sound therapy works when research is limited?

Research captures average effects across populations. Individual children respond differently. A lack of published studies doesn't mean an approach won't help your specific child. Parent experience is valid evidence, even when clinical trials haven't caught up. The key is being honest about what research shows versus personal experience.

### Should I invest in expensive sound therapy programmes?

We'd encourage caution, especially with programmes making bold claims. The Tomatis Method and AIT cost £1,200-2,000+ but have weak evidence bases. Start with accessible, affordable approaches first. If you're considering practitioner-delivered options like SSP, ask about their training and the evidence behind their claims.

### How long until I see results from sound therapy?

This depends on your goals and your child. Some parents notice calmer bedtimes within a week of consistent use. Others find benefits emerge gradually over months. Clinical changes (like auditory processing improvements) typically require longer-term intervention. Daily regulation support may show faster results. The common thread? Consistency matters more than intensity.
