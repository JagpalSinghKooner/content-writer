# LinkedIn Content: What Is Sound Therapy for Children?

## Carousel (8 slides)

### Slide 1: Hook
**"Sound therapy for kids..."**

...means wildly different things depending on who you ask.

Is it music therapy? Special headphones? Those frequencies everyone talks about?

Swipe → for the clear breakdown every confused parent needs

### Slide 2: The Problem
**Most parents are googling "sound therapy" at 2am**

Your child still can't settle.

Someone mentioned sound therapy could help.

But you're met with:
• Expensive programmes
• Conflicting advice
• Clinical jargon

Let's cut through the fog.

### Slide 3: What It Actually Means
**Sound therapy = using sound to support wellbeing**

For neurodivergent children, this covers:
• Practitioner-led programmes
• Binaural beats
• Frequency-based sounds
• ASMR and soundscapes
• Passive vs active approaches

Each serves a different purpose.

### Slide 4: The Critical Distinction
**Passive vs Active**

Active (like music therapy):
• Requires engagement
• Child participates
• Works with a therapist

Passive (like sound therapy):
• Press play, that's it
• No choices needed
• Zero demands

When your child is overwhelmed, only passive works.

### Slide 5: What Sound Therapy CAN Do
✓ Provide calming sensory input
✓ Support sleep routines
✓ Help with transitions
✓ Offer regulation during difficult moments
✓ Create predictable, safe sound environments
✓ Be used at home without specialist equipment

### Slide 6: What It CANNOT Do
✗ Cure autism (and we wouldn't want it to)
✗ Replace professional support when needed
✗ Work the same for every child
✗ Compensate for overwhelming environments
✗ Fix underlying needs requiring other support

Realistic expectations matter.

### Slide 7: Getting Started Tonight
You don't need expensive equipment.

Start simple:
• Try different sound types
• Notice what your child responds to
• Keep it passive (no demands)
• Create consistency

The same child might need different sounds at different times.

### Slide 8: CTA
**Found this useful?**

→ Follow for more neurodivergent parenting support
→ Repost to help other exhausted parents
→ Try sounds from The Open Sanctuary tonight

## Text Post 1: The 2am Realisation

It's 2am and you're googling "sound therapy for children" again.

Your little one still can't settle. Someone on a forum mentioned sound therapy might help. But every search gives you conflicting information.

Here's what confused me most when I first looked into this:

"Sound therapy" means completely different things depending on who you ask. Is it music therapy with a trained therapist? Those special headphones that cost thousands? The frequencies everyone talks about on social media? Something you can try tonight, or something you need an appointment for?

The confusion is the problem.

You can't know whether sound therapy might help your child until you understand what you're actually talking about.

So here's the clearest breakdown I can give:

**Sound therapy is an umbrella term** for any approach that uses sound to support wellbeing, regulation, or sensory processing. For autistic and neurodivergent children, this includes:

1. **Practitioner-led programmes** (like SSP or Tomatis) — structured, clinical, often expensive
2. **Binaural beats** — specific frequencies played through headphones to influence brain states
3. **Frequency-based sounds** — Hz-specific tones (432Hz, 528Hz, solfeggio frequencies)
4. **ASMR and soundscapes** — gentle, sensory-friendly audio environments
5. **Passive vs active listening** — and this distinction matters enormously

That last one is key. When your child is mid-meltdown or exhausted, they can't engage with anything demanding. Active music therapy might be brilliant at other times, but during overwhelm? They need passive listening. Press play. That's it. No tapping, no choices, no demands.

The type of sound therapy that helps your child depends entirely on what they need and when they need it.

We built HushAway® because we couldn't find passive, neurodivergent-first sound support that actually understood what "exhausted parent with overwhelmed child" really means.

If you're in that 2am search spiral right now, explore The Open Sanctuary. Try different sounds. See what your child responds to. No pressure, no signup barriers, just sounds you can try tonight.

What helped you find your way through the sound therapy confusion?

## Text Post 2: The Passive vs Active Distinction

This distinction changed everything for us, and I rarely see it explained clearly.

**Active music engagement** (including most music therapy) requires the child to participate. They might play instruments, sing, move to music, or interact with a therapist. The engagement is the point.

**Passive listening approaches** require nothing from the child. Press play and listen. No choices, no interaction, no demands.

For many neurodivergent children, especially during overwhelm or exhaustion, passive listening is the only thing that works.

Here's why this matters so much:

When your child is mid-meltdown or post-meltdown, their system is already overloaded. Anything that asks something of them adds to that load. "Pick this instrument." "Follow this breathing exercise." "Tap here to continue."

They can't. Not right now.

Passive sound support doesn't ask anything. It's just there if they want it. No decisions, no interaction, no additional cognitive load.

This is exactly why we designed HushAway® the way we did:

✓ Press play, that's it
✓ No tapping, no choices
✓ No "are you still listening?" interruptions
✓ No sensory surprises (no sudden changes or jarring transitions)

Both active and passive approaches have value. Music therapy can be brilliant for development, connection, and working on specific goals. But during the moments when your child genuinely cannot engage? Passive listening is what works.

It's not about one being better than the other. It's about having the right tool for the moment you're actually in.

If you've been trying "calming apps" that still require your child to make choices or tap through options, try something truly passive instead. The difference is significant.

What's your experience with this? Does your child have different needs at different times?

## Text Post 3: What Sound Therapy Can (and Can't) Do

Let's be really clear about realistic expectations.

After working with hundreds of families and seeing what sound therapy actually does (not what it's marketed as doing), here's the honest version:

**Sound therapy CAN:**
• Provide calming sensory input
• Support sleep routines
• Help with transitions between activities
• Offer regulation support during difficult moments
• Create predictable, safe sound environments
• Be used at home without specialist equipment

**Sound therapy CANNOT:**
• Cure autism (and we wouldn't want it to)
• Replace professional support when it's needed
• Work the same way for every child
• Compensate for sensory environments that are fundamentally overwhelming
• Fix underlying needs that require other interventions

Research shows mixed evidence. Some approaches show promise. Others lack strong research support. A 2022 systematic review found that sound-based interventions for autism have varying levels of evidence.

I'd rather you went in with realistic expectations than feel let down later.

Sound therapy isn't magic. But for many families, it's become one useful tool among many.

Here's what parents actually tell us:

"It doesn't fix everything, but bedtime is less of a battle."
"After-school meltdowns are shorter when we use the frequencies."
"She asks for her 'calm sounds' now when she needs to reset."

That's the reality. Not transformation. Not cure. Just... support. Another option in the toolkit. Something that helps in specific moments.

We built HushAway® with that honest framing. It's not going to solve everything. But it might help with bedtime tonight. Or the car journey tomorrow. Or that post-school overwhelm that happens every single day at 3:45pm.

If that's useful to you, explore The Open Sanctuary. Try different sounds. Notice what actually helps your child, not what you think should help.

What's been your experience with sound-based approaches?
