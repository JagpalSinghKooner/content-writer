# Instagram Content: What Is Sound Therapy for Children?

## Carousel (10 slides)

### Slide 1: Cover
**"Sound therapy for kids"**

means 5 completely different things

(No wonder you're confused)

### Slide 2: The 2am Search
**You're googling at 2am**

Your child can't settle

Someone said sound therapy might help

But every search gives you conflicting advice

What even IS sound therapy?

### Slide 3: The Simple Answer
**Sound therapy =**

using sound to support wellbeing

For neurodivergent children, this includes:
• Clinical programmes
• Binaural beats
• Frequency sounds
• ASMR & soundscapes
• Passive listening

### Slide 4: Type 1
**Practitioner-Led Programmes**

Like SSP, Tomatis, AIT

✓ Structured & clinical
✓ Often expensive
✓ Needs professional
✓ 10-40 sessions

### Slide 5: Type 2
**Binaural Beats**

Different frequencies:

Delta → Deep sleep
Theta → Relaxation
Alpha → Calm focus
Beta → Active attention

Needs stereo headphones

### Slide 6: Type 3
**Frequency-Based Sounds**

432 Hz
528 Hz
Solfeggio frequencies

Research limited, but many parents say these help

### Slide 7: Type 4
**ASMR & Soundscapes**

Gentle, calming sounds:
• Whispering
• Soft tapping
• Nature sounds
• Ambient textures

Not everyone experiences ASMR
But for those who do, it's powerful

### Slide 8: The Critical Distinction
**PASSIVE vs ACTIVE**

Active (music therapy):
Requires engagement
Child participates

Passive (sound therapy):
Press play, that's it
Zero demands

When overwhelmed, only passive works

### Slide 9: Realistic Expectations
**Sound therapy CAN:**
✓ Calm sensory input
✓ Support sleep
✓ Help transitions
✓ Work at home

**Sound therapy CANNOT:**
✗ Cure autism
✗ Replace professional support
✗ Work the same for every child

### Slide 10: CTA
**Start tonight**

## Caption

It's 2am and you're googling "sound therapy for children" again.

Your little one still can't settle. You're exhausted. Someone on a forum mentioned sound therapy might help.

But every search gives you conflicting information. Is it music therapy? Special headphones? Those frequencies everyone talks about? Something you can try tonight, or something you need appointments for?

.
.
.

Here's what confused me most: "sound therapy" means completely different things depending on who you ask.

Sound therapy is an umbrella term for any approach that uses sound to support wellbeing or sensory processing. For neurodivergent children, this includes practitioner-led programmes, binaural beats, frequency-based sounds, ASMR and soundscapes, and the critical distinction between passive and active listening.

That last one changed everything for us. When your child is mid-meltdown or exhausted, they can't engage with anything demanding. Active music therapy might be brilliant at other times. But during overwhelm? They need passive listening. Press play. That's it. No tapping, no choices, no demands.

We built HushAway because we couldn't find passive, neurodivergent-first sound support that actually understood what exhausted parents need.

Sound therapy isn't magic. But for many families, it's become one useful tool among many. Something that helps with bedtime tonight. Or the car journey tomorrow. Or that post-school overwhelm.

If that sounds familiar, explore The Open Sanctuary (link in bio). Try different sounds. See what your child responds to. No pressure, just sounds you can try tonight.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"You're googling 'sound therapy for children' at 2am and it makes NO sense"

[Visual: Parent on phone, exhausted, confused scrolling]

**[3-22 seconds: VALUE]**
"Here's why: Sound therapy means 5 different things.

One: Clinical programmes with therapists—expensive, structured.

Two: Binaural beats—specific frequencies through headphones.

Three: Frequency sounds—432Hz, 528Hz, solfeggio tones.

Four: ASMR and soundscapes—gentle, sensory-friendly.

Five: Passive vs active listening—and THIS is the game-changer.

When your child is overwhelmed, they can't engage with anything demanding. Passive listening means: press play, that's it. No choices, no tapping, zero demands."

[Visual: Quick cuts showing each type, ending on calm child with headphones, parent relieved]

**[22-30 seconds: CTA]**
"You can try passive sound therapy tonight. Link in bio to explore The Open Sanctuary—no signup barriers, just sounds."
