# Newsletter Snippet: Sound Therapy for Children (Pillar Guide)

## Hook

You've probably Googled "sound therapy for children" at 11pm. Maybe after another meltdown. Maybe after lying next to your child for two hours waiting for them to fall asleep. You're wondering if any of it is actually real.

## Body

Every other guide tells you what sound therapy CAN do. We're telling you what it actually DOES, backed by the evidence that exists and honest about the evidence that doesn't.

Here's why that honesty matters: if you're reading this in the UK, you're probably facing a 24-month wait for an NHS assessment. You can't afford to waste time on approaches that don't work. But you also can't wait two years doing nothing.

Sound therapy isn't a miracle cure. What it can do is provide accessible, low-cost, daily regulation support whilst you wait. That might sound modest, but we'd rather you trust us with an honest assessment than distrust us after we oversold something.

**What research actually supports:** calming effects, sleep support, anxiety reduction. **What research is mixed on:** attention and focus, sensory processing. **What research does NOT support:** expensive clinical programmes, specific healing frequencies, replacing professional treatment.

The complete guide covers everything UK parents need to know: what types exist, which children benefit most, how to use it at home, and when it's not enough. Evidence-first. No promises. Just what actually works.
