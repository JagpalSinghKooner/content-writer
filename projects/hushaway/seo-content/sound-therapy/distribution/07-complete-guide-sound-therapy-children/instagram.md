You've probably Googled this at 11pm. Maybe after another meltdown. Maybe after hours waiting for them to fall asleep.

Here's the truth about sound therapy for children that most guides won't tell you: it's not a miracle cure. It won't replace professional support when your child needs it.

What it can do is provide accessible, low-cost, daily regulation support whilst you wait for assessments (24 months+), try other approaches, and alongside whatever else you're doing.

That might sound modest compared to what you'll read elsewhere. Good. We'd rather you trust us with an honest assessment than distrust us after we oversold something.

**What research actually supports:** Calming effects (reduced heart rate and cortisol), sleep support (improved onset and quality), anxiety reduction (modest but consistent findings).

**What research is mixed on:** Attention and focus (inconsistent results), sensory processing differences (varies by child).

**What research does NOT support:** Expensive clinical programmes, specific healing frequencies, replacing professional treatment.

The complete guide covers everything UK parents need to know: what types exist, which children benefit most, how to use it at home, and when it's not enough. Evidence-first. No promises. Just what actually works.

Because you've been trying so hard for so long. And you deserve something that might actually make tonight a little easier.
