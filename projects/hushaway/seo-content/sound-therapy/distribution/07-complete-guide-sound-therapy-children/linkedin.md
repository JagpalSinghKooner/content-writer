# LinkedIn Content: Sound Therapy for Children (Pillar Guide)

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
**You've probably Googled this at 11pm**

After another meltdown. After hours waiting for them to fall asleep.

Swipe → for the honest UK guide to sound therapy for children

### Slide 2: The Problem
You're facing a 24-month NHS wait.

You can't afford to waste time on approaches that don't work.

But you also can't wait two years doing nothing.

### Slide 3: What Sound Therapy IS
An accessible, low-cost way to support daily regulation.

Passive listening. No demands. Just press play.

Works whilst you wait for assessments, alongside other support.

### Slide 4: What Sound Therapy ISN'T
Not a miracle cure.

Not a replacement for professional support.

Not backed by research for every claim you'll read elsewhere.

We're giving you the honest version.

### Slide 5: What Research Supports
✓ Calming effects (reduced heart rate, cortisol)
✓ Sleep support (improved onset and quality)
✓ Anxiety reduction (modest but consistent)

### Slide 6: What Research Is Mixed On
△ Attention and focus (inconsistent results)
△ Sensory processing (varies by child)
△ Specific frequencies (claims lack evidence)

### Slide 7: Which Children Benefit Most
• Sensory seekers
• Children with sleep difficulties
• Anxious children
• Children who find interaction exhausting

The zero-demand approach is the point.

### Slide 8: How to Use It at Home
Equipment: Device that plays audio, that's it.

When: Bedtime, after school, meltdown recovery.

Volume: Quieter than you think.

Consistency: Five minutes daily beats an hour weekly.

### Slide 9: The Different Types
• Binaural beats (modest evidence)
• Solfeggio frequencies (tradition, not research)
• ASMR sounds (calming for many)
• Ambient soundscapes (reliable starting point)

### Slide 10: Summary
Quick recap:

✓ Not magic, but can help
✓ Strong safety profile
✓ Works at home, tonight
✓ Complements professional support
✓ Honest about what research supports

### Slide 11: CTA
**You've read the guide. Now try something.**

The Open Sanctuary: Curated sounds for neurodivergent children.

No commitment. Just sounds you can try tonight.

You've probably Googled this at 11pm.

Maybe after another meltdown. Maybe after lying next to your child for two hours waiting for them to fall asleep.

Here's the truth about sound therapy for children that most guides won't tell you:

It's not a miracle cure. It won't replace professional support when your child needs it.

What it can do is provide accessible, low-cost, daily regulation support whilst you wait for assessments (24 months+, anyone?), whilst you try other approaches, and alongside whatever else you're doing.

That might sound modest compared to what you'll read elsewhere. Good. We'd rather you trust us with an honest assessment than distrust us after we oversold something.

**What research actually supports:**

• Calming effects (reduced heart rate and cortisol)
• Sleep support (improved onset and quality)
• Anxiety reduction (modest but consistent findings)

**What research is mixed on:**

• Attention and focus (inconsistent results)
• Sensory processing differences (varies by child)

**What research does NOT support:**

• Expensive clinical programmes like Auditory Integration Training (Cochrane review found no evidence)
• Claims that specific frequencies heal specific conditions
• Replacing professional treatment when that's needed

Sound therapy is a tool, not a treatment. For some children, it works brilliantly. For others, it doesn't resonate. The only way to know is to try it.

And here's the thing: you can try it at home with equipment you already own. Tonight, if you want.

Because you've been trying so hard for so long. And you deserve something that might actually make tonight a little easier.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

"Does sound therapy work for children?"

I've just spent 4,500 words answering this question with actual evidence, not marketing speak.

The short version: it depends what you mean by "work."

**Passive listening (no interaction required):**

This is where sound therapy shines for neurodivergent children. Your child presses play (or you do). The sounds do the work whilst they rest, play, or drift off to sleep.

When your child is mid-meltdown, overwhelmed after school, or fighting sleep at 10pm, the last thing they need is another demand.

**What we know from research:**

Studies show certain sounds can reduce physiological stress markers. Music and ambient sounds improve sleep onset and quality. Binaural beats show some evidence for anxiety reduction.

**What we don't know:**

The evidence for attention and focus is inconsistent. Research on autistic children specifically is limited. Expensive clinical programmes lack evidence to support their claims.

**The types that cost nothing to try:**

• ASMR sounds and soundscapes
• Nature sounds and ambient audio
• Binaural beats (requires headphones)
• Solfeggio frequencies (tradition over evidence, but many parents report calming effects)

**Here's what matters most:**

You can do this at home. You don't need a practitioner, a clinic, or expensive equipment. Everything can be done with devices you already own.

Start with simple ambient sounds at bedtime. Five minutes. See what happens.

If it helps, brilliant. If it doesn't work, you've learned something about your child and you can try a different approach.

But at least you tried something tonight instead of waiting 24 months for an NHS assessment whilst doing nothing.

The honest guide to sound therapy for children is on our blog (link in comments). Evidence-first. No promises. Just what actually works.

The difference between sound therapy and music therapy matters.

**Music therapy:**
Active, practitioner-led. Your child plays instruments, sings, or responds to a therapist. Requires engagement.

**Sound therapy (passive listening):**
No interaction required. Your child simply listens whilst the sounds do the work.

Both have value. They serve different purposes.

But here's why passive listening matters for neurodivergent children:

When your child is overwhelmed, they can't engage. When they're mid-meltdown, they can't respond to demands. When they're fighting sleep at 10pm, they don't have capacity for "one more thing."

Passive listening meets them where they are. Press play. That's it.

**The types of passive sound therapy:**

• Binaural beats (modest evidence for anxiety, attention)
• Solfeggio frequencies (tradition more than research)
• ASMR sounds (calming for many, evidence growing)
• Ambient soundscapes (reliable starting point)

**When to use which:**

Bedtime: Ambient sounds, frequencies, sleep stories
After school: ASMR, frequencies (decompress from overload)
Meltdown recovery: Frequencies, simple soundscapes
Homework: Binaural beats for focus

**The golden rules:**

Start quiet (much quieter than you think)
Let them choose (control increases engagement)
Consistency over perfection (five minutes daily beats an hour weekly)
No forcing (if they resist, try different sounds or different times)

We've created a complete guide to sound therapy for children with everything UK parents need to know. What research supports, what types exist, how to use it at home, and when it's not enough.

Link in comments. Evidence-first. Parent-friendly. Honest about limitations.

Because you deserve to know what you're trying before you try it.
