## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
ARE BINAURAL BEATS
SAFE FOR YOUR CHILD?

Here's what parents
actually need to know

[Bold white text on calming gradient background]

### Slide 2: What They Are
Binaural beats aren't sounds.

They're an auditory illusion
your brain creates.

Different frequencies
in each ear = perceived beat

[Simple graphic showing two ears with different Hz numbers]

### Slide 3: The Honest Truth
The research on binaural beats
for children is limited.

We don't have large studies
proving they work for kids.

We also don't have evidence
they're harmful.

### Slide 4: Risk Profile
What we CAN say confidently:

Binaural beats appear to be
low-risk.

They're just sound.

[Calming colour scheme, reassuring tone]

✗ Epilepsy or seizure disorders
✗ Auditory sensitivities
✗ Under 3 years old
✗ Anxiety about headphones

### Slide 6: The Requirement
Stereo headphones
are REQUIRED.

Not optional. Required.

What frequency for what:

🌙 Delta (1-4 Hz) → Deep sleep
🌊 Theta (4-8 Hz) → Relaxation
☀️ Alpha (8-13 Hz) → Calm focus
⚡ Beta (13-20 Hz) → Active attention

### Slide 8: Getting It Right

✓ Give it 2 weeks
✓ Listen to your child

### Slide 9: Individual Responses

Are binaural beats safe for your child? 🎧

You typed it into Google at 11pm. Again.

Here's the honest answer most websites won't give you: the research on binaural beats for children is limited. We don't have large studies proving they work for kids. We also don't have evidence they're harmful.

What we have is a low-risk option worth understanding before you decide whether to try it.

Binaural beats aren't sounds. They're an auditory illusion your brain creates when different frequencies reach each ear. The idea is that this perceived frequency can encourage your brain to match it, potentially supporting different mental states like relaxation or focus.

The main things to know: stereo headphones are required (speakers don't work at all), the research is mixed, individual responses vary enormously, and some children find them helpful while others find them annoying.

Should you try them? That depends on your circumstances, your child's preferences, and your expectations. If you're looking for a guaranteed solution, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for one low-risk thing to try as part of a broader approach? It might be worth exploring.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. 🌙
