# Newsletter Snippet: Sound Therapy at Home

## Hook

You've probably seen the sound therapy programmes. The ones that cost hundreds of pounds, require practitioner sessions, and involve weeks of commitment before you see any benefit. And you've probably thought: this isn't for families like mine.

Here's what nobody tells you: you don't need any of that to use sound therapy with your child. You can start tonight, with equipment you already own.

## Body

If you've ever put on nature sounds at bedtime and watched your child's breathing slow, you've already done a form of sound therapy. The only difference between that and "proper" sound therapy is intention and consistency.

Most of what helps neurodivergent children calm, focus, and settle doesn't require a practitioner at all. It requires understanding which sounds support which situations, and building them into daily routines rather than reaching for them only during crisis.

**What actually works:**

For bedtime: Nature sounds, gentle instrumental music, or ASMR sounds. Start during the bedtime routine (not when your child is already in bed struggling). Keep volume low. Use the same sounds each night to build association.

For focus: Binaural beats, white/pink/brown noise, or lo-fi ambient music. From the start of homework, not when focus is already lost. The sound creates the environment for concentration to happen.

For emotional overwhelm: Lower frequencies (174 Hz, 285 Hz) or simple ambient sounds. Best used for recovery and prevention, not during acute meltdown. Simple, steady sounds provide regulation without adding cognitive load.

The biggest mistake parents make? Only using sound during crisis. Sound therapy builds association over time. Your child's brain learns: "This sound means calm is coming." But that learning requires repetition. Daily routines beat emergency intervention every time.

You already have the equipment. A phone, a speaker, a quiet-ish space. That's it. The barrier isn't access—it's knowing how to use what you already have.
