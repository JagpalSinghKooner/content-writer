# LinkedIn Content: Sound Therapy at Home

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
You don't need a clinic.
You don't need a practitioner.
You don't need hundreds of pounds.

Sound therapy at home starts tonight.

Swipe → to learn how

### Slide 2: The Real Barrier
Most sound therapy resources come from practitioners who want you to book their services.

But here's what they don't tell you:

Much of what helps neurodivergent children doesn't require a practitioner at all.

### Slide 3: What You Already Have
Essential equipment:
• A phone or tablet
• A bluetooth speaker (or device speaker)
• A quiet-ish space
• That's it.

You don't need special headphones, soundproofing, or expensive programmes.

### Slide 4: Match Sounds to Situations
Bedtime → Nature sounds, gentle instrumental, low frequency ambient

Emotional overwhelm → Frequencies (174 Hz, 285 Hz), simple ambient sounds

Focus time → Binaural beats, white/pink/brown noise, lo-fi music

Transitions → Predictable sound sequences that signal what's coming

### Slide 5: What Actually Works
Not "calming videos" with visual stimulation.

Not apps that require interaction.

Just passive listening. Audio-only. Press play.

Your child's brain does the rest.

### Slide 6: Know It's Working When...
Immediate signs:
• Shoulders drop
• Breathing slows
• Movement calms
• Eye contact available (if typical when calm)

Over time:
• Bedtime takes less time
• Meltdown recovery faster
• Your child asks for specific sounds

### Slide 7: Common Mistakes
❌ Only using sound during crisis
❌ Giving up after two tries
❌ Forcing sounds your child hates
❌ Playing stimulating content

✓ Build sound into daily routines
✓ Give new approaches 2 weeks minimum
✓ Follow your child's sensory preferences

### Slide 8: Start Tonight
1. Pick one situation (bedtime easiest)
2. Choose simple sound (rain, ocean, ambient)
3. Start playing 15 minutes before bed
4. Keep volume low
5. Let it continue after lights out
6. Just notice what happens

No pressure. Just presence.

### Slide 9: Summary
Quick recap:
• Use equipment you already have
• Match sounds to specific situations
• Audio-only, no interaction required
• Build into daily routines, not just crisis
• Give it 2 weeks before deciding

### Slide 10: CTA
One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

You don't need a clinic to use sound therapy with your child.

After 7 years running a nursery and training as a sound therapy practitioner, here's what I've learned: the biggest barrier to sound therapy isn't access to practitioners. It's the belief that you need them at all.

Most parents don't realise they've already been doing a form of sound therapy. If you've ever:
• Put on nature sounds at bedtime and watched breathing slow
• Noticed certain music helps homework focus
• Used white noise to calm a baby

You've used sound to support regulation. The only difference between that and "sound therapy at home" is intention and consistency.

Here's what actually works:

**For bedtime:** Nature sounds, gentle instrumental, ASMR sounds. Start during the bedtime routine, not when your child is already struggling. Keep volume low. Use the same sounds each night to build association.

**For emotional overwhelm:** Lower frequencies (174 Hz, 285 Hz), simple ambient sounds. Not during acute meltdown, but for recovery and prevention. Simple, steady sounds provide regulation without adding cognitive load.

**For focus:** Binaural beats (need headphones), white/pink/brown noise, lo-fi ambient music. Try different types. Some children focus better with total silence. Volume matters more than you'd think.

**For transitions:** Predictable sound sequences. Same sounds each morning, each school departure, each mealtime. The routine builds the association that makes transitions easier.

What you need to get started:
• A device that plays audio (phone, tablet, speaker)
• A quiet-ish space (perfection not required)
• One situation to target first

That's it.

No waiting lists. No driving across town. No spending money you don't have.

One challenge: knowing if it's working without a practitioner tracking progress. Here's what to watch for:

Immediate signs: visible relaxation, breathing slows, movement calms, verbal communication easier.

Over time: bedtime takes less time, meltdown recovery faster, your child asks for specific sounds, homework sessions extend.

If you see no difference after two weeks of consistent use, adjust. Try different sound types, different volumes, different times of day, different delivery methods. Your child's response tells you whether a sound is right for them.

Sound therapy at home isn't magic. It won't cure ADHD or autism. It won't replace sleep, nutrition, or appropriate professional support when needed.

But it can provide one more tool in your toolkit. A way to make hard moments a bit easier. Support that doesn't require appointments, doesn't cost ongoing fees, doesn't add demands to an already overwhelmed child.

Sometimes one quiet moment changes a whole day. That's worth having.

What sounds have you noticed help your child? Drop a comment—I'd love to know what's working in your home.

The biggest mistake parents make with home sound therapy: only reaching for it during crisis.

I get it. You're exhausted. Your child is melting down. You grab whatever might help in the moment.

But here's the thing: sound therapy works best as prevention and routine support, not emergency intervention.

Think about it this way. If you only put on calming sounds when your child is already overwhelmed, you're asking sound to do something it's not designed for. You're asking it to reverse a nervous system that's already flooded, in a moment when processing capacity is at its lowest.

That's not how regulation works.

Sound therapy builds association over time. Your child's brain learns: "This sound means calm is coming. This sound means sleep follows. This sound means focus time."

But that learning requires repetition. Consistency. The same sounds, in the same contexts, building neural pathways between sound and state.

Here's what works better:

**Morning wake-up:** Gentle, energising sounds. Same sequence every morning. Not to wake them (that's miserable), but to ease the transition from sleep to awake. Start playing before you go into their room.

**After-school decompression:** 15-20 minutes of ASMR sounds or frequencies as soon as they get home. Before homework. Before questions about their day. Just space to settle after sensory overload.

**Homework time:** Binaural beats or brown noise from the start of the session, not when focus is already lost. The sound creates the environment for concentration to happen.

**Bedtime routine:** Sound starts during the routine (bath time, pyjamas, teeth brushing), not when they're already in bed struggling to switch off. By the time they're under the covers, their nervous system is already settling.

**Transition points:** Car journeys. Getting ready for school. Mealtimes. Anywhere your child typically struggles. Predictable sounds at predictable moments teach the brain what's coming next.

When you build sound into routine rather than reaching for it in crisis, two things happen:

1. Your child's nervous system learns to respond to the sound cue. The association strengthens. The regulation happens faster.

2. You're using sound proactively, which means fewer crises in the first place. Prevention beats intervention every time.

Does this mean sound can't help in acute moments? No. Some children find frequencies or simple ambient sounds helpful during meltdown recovery. But that's recovery, not interruption. And it works better when the association is already there.

Start with one routine. Just one. Pick the moment that's hardest in your household right now, and add sound to that context for two weeks straight.

Not "when I remember." Not "when it's really bad." Every single day, same sound, same situation.

That's when you'll see what sound therapy at home can actually do.

What's the hardest transition in your day right now? That's where I'd start.

"Will this work for my child's specific diagnosis?"

I get asked this a lot. Parents want to know if sound therapy works for ADHD, or autism, or sensory processing disorder specifically.

Here's the honest answer: sound therapy isn't diagnosis-specific.

It supports regulation, focus, and calm in ways that help most children, regardless of whether they have ADHD, autism, sensory processing differences, or no diagnosis at all.

Because here's what people misunderstand about diagnosis. Diagnosis describes patterns of traits and behaviours. It helps with access to support, understanding, community.

But when it comes to what actually helps your child in the moment? Diagnosis tells you less than you think.

Two children with ADHD can have completely different sensory profiles. One might find white noise grounding. The other might find it overwhelming.

Two autistic children might have opposite responses to the same frequency. One calms. One gets agitated.

Your child isn't their diagnosis. They're a unique sensory system with unique preferences, unique thresholds, unique responses.

So when people ask "does sound therapy work for ADHD?", what they're really asking is: "Will specific sounds help my child with specific struggles in specific contexts?"

And that's a question only your child can answer.

What I can tell you is this:

**What tends to work for bedtime struggles** (regardless of diagnosis): nature sounds, gentle instrumental, low frequency ambient sounds, ASMR. These sounds create a consistent, non-stimulating auditory blanket that helps the nervous system settle.

**What tends to work for focus challenges** (regardless of diagnosis): binaural beats, white/pink/brown noise, lo-fi ambient music. These sounds mask distracting environmental noise while providing a steady auditory anchor.

**What tends to work for emotional overwhelm** (regardless of diagnosis): frequencies (174 Hz, 285 Hz), simple ambient sounds without sudden changes. These provide regulation support without adding cognitive load.

**What tends to work for sensory overload** (regardless of diagnosis): ASMR sounds, frequencies, minimal ambient soundscapes. These offer a controlled sensory input that can ground without overwhelming.

But "tends to work" isn't "will definitely work for your child."

The only way to know what helps your child is to try, observe, and adjust. Your child's response—visible relaxation, breathing changes, ability to engage—tells you everything diagnosis can't.

This is why home sound therapy makes so much sense. You're not waiting for a practitioner to tell you what should work based on a diagnostic label. You're watching your child, noticing what actually works, and doing more of that.

Some children with ADHD love binaural beats. Others hate them.
Some autistic children find frequencies soothing. Others find them painful.
Some children need silence. Others need sound.

Your child will show you what they need. You just have to watch, listen, and trust what you see.

Sound therapy at home isn't about applying a protocol to a diagnosis. It's about finding the sounds that support your specific child in their specific struggles at their specific moments.

Start with one sound type. Try it consistently for a week. Watch what happens. Adjust. Repeat.

That's how you find what works. Not by diagnosis. By response.

What sounds have you noticed your child responds to? I'd love to hear what you're discovering.
