# Twitter/X Content: Sound Therapy at Home

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
You don't need a clinic to use sound therapy with your child.

You don't need a practitioner. You don't need hundreds of pounds.

You need a phone and 15 minutes.

Here's how to start tonight 🧵

### Tweet 2
First: you've probably already done a form of sound therapy.

If you've ever put on nature sounds at bedtime and watched your child's breathing slow?

That's sound therapy.

The only difference is intention and consistency.

### Tweet 3
What you actually need:

• A device that plays audio (phone, tablet, speaker)
• A quiet-ish space (perfection not required)
• One situation to target first

That's it.

No waiting lists. No expensive programmes. No driving across town.

### Tweet 4
Match sounds to situations:

Bedtime → Nature sounds, gentle instrumental, low frequency ambient

Overwhelm → Frequencies (174 Hz, 285 Hz), simple ambient sounds

Focus → Binaural beats, white/pink/brown noise

Transitions → Predictable sequences

### Tweet 5
The biggest mistake: only using sound during crisis.

Sound therapy works best as prevention, not emergency intervention.

Build it into routines:
• Morning wake-up
• After-school reset
• Homework time
• Bedtime routine

Daily. Same sound. Same context.

### Tweet 6
How to know it's working:

Immediate:
• Visible relaxation
• Breathing slows
• Movement calms

Over time:
• Bedtime takes less time
• Meltdown recovery faster
• Your child asks for specific sounds

### Tweet 7
Common mistakes to avoid:

❌ Only reaching for sound in crisis
❌ Giving up after 2 tries
❌ Forcing sounds your child hates
❌ Using "calming videos" with visual stimulation

✓ Audio-only, passive listening

### Tweet 8
What about diagnosis?

Sound therapy isn't diagnosis-specific.

It supports regulation, focus, calm in ways that help most children—whether they have ADHD, autism, SPD, or no diagnosis at all.

Your child's response tells you what works, not their label.

### Tweet 9
Start tonight:

1. Pick one situation (bedtime is easiest)
2. Choose a simple sound (rain, ocean, ambient)
3. Start playing 15 min before bed
4. Keep volume low
5. Let it continue after lights out
6. Just notice what happens

No pressure. Just presence.

### Tweet 10 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Use equipment you already have
• Match sounds to specific situations
• Build into routines, not just crisis
• Give it 2 weeks before deciding
• Your child's response tells you what works

Sound therapy at home is accessible. You can start tonight.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
The biggest barrier to sound therapy isn't access to practitioners.

It's the belief that you need them at all.

Most parents don't realise: they've already been doing a form of sound therapy every time they put on white noise or nature sounds.

The only difference is intention.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

"Does sound therapy work for ADHD/autism/SPD?" is the wrong question.

The right question: "Which sounds help my specific child with their specific struggles?"

Diagnosis describes patterns. Your child's sensory system is unique.

Response > label.

### Tweet C (Practical Tip)
Home sound therapy starter pack:

• Bedtime: Rain sounds or ocean waves
• Focus: Brown noise or binaural beats
• Overwhelm recovery: 174 Hz frequency
• Transitions: Same song every morning

Try one for 2 weeks straight before adding more.

Consistency > variety.

### Tweet D (Validation)
You're not "bad at bedtime."

Your child isn't broken.

Sometimes a nervous system just needs a sound blanket to settle.

15 minutes of gentle ambient sound before bed can change everything.

You don't need a practitioner to try it tonight.

### Tweet E (List)
5 things you already have that work for home sound therapy:

• Phone speaker
• Bluetooth speaker
• Tablet
• Laptop
• Smart speaker

You don't need special equipment.
You don't need headphones (unless using binaural beats).
You just need to press play.
