# Instagram Content: Sound Therapy at Home

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
YOU DON'T NEED
A CLINIC

Sound therapy at home
starts tonight

[Bold text on calming background—soft blues or greens, high contrast]

### Slide 2: The Belief That Stops You
You think you need:
❌ A practitioner
❌ Special equipment
❌ Hundreds of pounds
❌ Weeks of training

You don't.

### Slide 3: What You Actually Need
✓ A phone or speaker
✓ A quiet-ish space
✓ 15 minutes
✓ One situation to start with

That's it.

### Slide 4: If You've Done This...
Put on nature sounds at bedtime?

Noticed certain music helps focus?

Used white noise to calm?

You've already done sound therapy.

### Slide 5: Match Sound to Situation
BEDTIME
Nature sounds, gentle music, ASMR

OVERWHELM
Frequencies (174 Hz, 285 Hz)

FOCUS
Binaural beats, brown noise

TRANSITIONS
Same sequence daily

### Slide 6: The Biggest Mistake
Only reaching for sound during crisis.

Sound therapy works best as prevention.

Build it into routines:
Morning, after school, homework, bedtime.

Daily. Same sound. Same context.

### Slide 7: How You Know It's Working
IMMEDIATE:
• Shoulders drop
• Breathing slows
• Movement calms

OVER TIME:
• Bedtime takes less time
• Recovery faster
• Child asks for sounds

### Slide 8: What Doesn't Work
❌ "Calming videos" (visual stimulation)
❌ Apps requiring interaction
❌ Forcing sounds child hates
❌ Giving up after 2 tries

✓ Audio-only
✓ Passive listening
✓ Follow child's cues

### Slide 9: Diagnosis Doesn't Matter
"Will this work for ADHD?"
"What about autism?"
"Does it help SPD?"

Wrong questions.

Right question:
"Which sounds help MY child with THEIR struggles?"

Your child's response tells you everything.

### Slide 10: Start Tonight
1. Pick one situation
2. Choose simple sound
3. Play 15 min before transition
4. Keep volume low
5. Notice what happens

No pressure.
Just presence.

## Caption

You don't need a clinic to use sound therapy with your child.

After 7 years running a nursery and training as a sound therapy practitioner, here's what I've learned: the biggest barrier isn't access to practitioners. It's the belief that you need them at all.

.
.
.

If you've ever put on nature sounds at bedtime and watched your child's breathing slow, you've already done a form of sound therapy. The only difference between that and "proper" sound therapy is intention and consistency.

Here's what actually works:

BEDTIME → Nature sounds, gentle instrumental, ASMR. Start during bedtime routine (not when they're already in bed). Keep volume low. Same sounds nightly.

FOCUS → Binaural beats, white/pink/brown noise. From the start of homework, not when focus is lost. Creates environment for concentration.

OVERWHELM → Frequencies (174 Hz, 285 Hz), simple ambient sounds. For recovery and prevention, not during acute meltdown.

TRANSITIONS → Predictable sequences. Same sounds each morning, after school, before meals. Routine builds association.

The biggest mistake? Only reaching for sound during crisis. Sound therapy builds over time. Your child's brain learns: "This sound means calm is coming." That requires repetition.

You already have the equipment. Phone, speaker, quiet-ish space. That's it.

Start with one routine. One situation that's hard in your household right now. Add sound to that context for two weeks straight. Same sound, same situation, every day.

Sometimes one quiet moment changes a whole day. That's worth having.

What sounds have you noticed help your child? Drop a comment—I'd love to know what's working 💙

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"You don't need a clinic for sound therapy. You need a phone and 15 minutes."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"Here's how to start tonight:

Pick one hard moment. Bedtime, homework, after school—whatever's toughest right now.

Choose a simple sound. Rain, ocean, gentle music. Audio only, no videos.

Start playing 15 minutes BEFORE that moment. Not during crisis. Before.

Keep it low. Background, not foreground.

Use the same sound every day for two weeks. Your child's brain builds the association: this sound means calm is coming.

Watch what happens. Shoulders drop. Breathing slows. Transitions get easier.

That's sound therapy at home. No practitioners. No waiting lists. Just you, your child, and a sound."
