# Instagram Content: Solfeggio Frequencies for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
"528 Hz HEALS DNA"

What research actually shows about solfeggio frequencies for children →

### Slide 2: The Claims
You've seen them everywhere:

• 528 Hz repairs DNA
• 432 Hz aligns with universe
• Ancient frequencies transform children

Curious? Sceptical?

Good. You should be both.

### Slide 3: What They Are
Solfeggio frequencies = specific sound tones from ancient traditions

Each frequency linked to different benefits (traditionally)

But tradition ≠ clinical proof

### Slide 4: The Evidence
Most studied: 528 Hz

Shows measurable stress effects in adults (small studies)

Child research? Almost none.

DNA claims? Zero support.

### Slide 5: Why Parents Use Them
Many observe genuine calming effects

Low risk, potential benefit

Passive listening = no demands on child

The ritual matters as much as the frequency

### Slide 6: Neurodivergent Children
Some ND children respond strongly to specific tones

Others are sensitive in uncomfortable ways

Advantage: Just press play. No interaction needed.

### Slide 7: Getting Started
→ Start with lower frequencies (174-396 Hz)
→ Keep volume low (background)
→ Try 15-20 minutes
→ Track what you observe
→ Trust your child's response

### Slide 8: The Honest Truth
Specific claims outpace evidence

But sound affects our bodies (proven)

Whether specific frequencies matter more? Still unclear.

### Slide 9: What Matters
Not what should work (claims)

Not what works for others

What works for YOUR child

Your observations count as evidence too

"528 Hz heals DNA." "432 Hz aligns you with the universe."

You've seen these claims about solfeggio frequencies.

.

Here's what the research actually shows: the specific claims outpace the evidence. The DNA repair promises, universal alignment, precise healing effects? No scientific support.

The most studied frequency (528 Hz) shows measurable effects on stress markers in adults. Small studies. Preliminary. But something is there. Child-specific research? Almost nonexistent.

Yet many parents find real value in these frequencies. Not because of mystical properties, but because children respond to predictable calming rituals. Because passive listening requires nothing from them—no demands, no interaction, just sound. Because when you're exhausted, low-risk exploration makes practical sense.

Some neurodivergent children show strong positive responses to specific tones. Deeply calming in ways neurotypical children don't experience. Others are sensitive in uncomfortable ways. Both responses are valid.

The sensible approach is neither wholesale rejection nor uncritical acceptance. Try if you're curious. Watch what happens. Keep expectations realistic. Trust what you observe in your own home.

What matters isn't what should work according to theory. What matters is what helps your child.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Stop. Before you buy that '528 Hz heals DNA' meditation for your child, let's talk about what research actually shows."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"I spent weeks reviewing solfeggio frequency studies. Here's the truth:

Most studied: 528 Hz. Shows some stress effects in adults. Small studies.

Child research? Almost none.

DNA repair claims? Zero scientific support.

But here's the complicated bit—many parents observe real calming effects. Something is happening. Whether it's the specific frequency, the ritual, or both, the effect is genuine.

Low risk. Passive listening. Worth exploring with realistic expectations."
