# LinkedIn Content: Solfeggio Frequencies for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
528 Hz heals DNA.
432 Hz aligns you with the universe.

Seen these claims?

Swipe → for what research actually shows

### Slide 2: What Are They?
Solfeggio frequencies = specific sound tones used in ancient traditions.

Each frequency traditionally linked to different benefits.

But tradition ≠ clinical evidence.

### Slide 3: The Evidence Gap
Most studied: 528 Hz
(the "love frequency")

Small studies show measurable effects on stress markers in adults.

Child-specific research? Almost none.

### Slide 4: The DNA Claims
"528 Hz repairs DNA"

Zero scientific support.

Same with most specific healing claims.

Be honest about what we don't know.

### Slide 5: Why Parents Use Them Anyway
Low risk. Potential benefit.

Many parents observe real calming effects.

Whether it's the frequency itself or the ritual? Both create value.

### Slide 6: Practical Reality
Start with lower frequencies (174-396 Hz) for grounding.

Keep volume low. Background level.

Track what you observe—not what claims say should happen.

### Slide 7: Neurodivergent Children
Some ND children respond strongly to specific tones.

Others are sensitive in uncomfortable ways.

The advantage? Passive listening. No demands. No interaction required.

### Slide 8: The Honest Truth
Specific claims outpace the evidence.

But the broader principle—that sound affects our bodies—has support.

Try if you're curious. Trust what you observe.

### Slide 9: Quick Recap
✓ Traditional use, limited research
✓ 528 Hz shows some promise (adults)
✓ DNA/healing claims unsupported
✓ Low risk, passive listening
✓ Watch your child's response

### Slide 10: CTA
Found this useful?

→ Follow for evidence-informed guidance on sound therapy for children
→ Save for when you're researching alternatives
→ Share with a parent exploring calming approaches

The solfeggio frequency claims you see on Instagram are outpacing the research. By a lot.

I've spent weeks digging through studies on 528 Hz, 432 Hz, and the other "healing frequencies" marketed to parents of neurodivergent children.

Here's what I found:

1. The most studied frequency (528 Hz) shows measurable effects on stress markers in adults. Small studies. Preliminary. But something is there.

2. Child-specific research? Almost nonexistent. We're extrapolating from adult studies and traditional use.

3. The DNA repair claims, universal alignment promises, and specific healing effects? No scientific support. None.

4. But here's the complicated bit—many parents observe genuine calming effects. Their children respond. Something real is happening.

So what do we do with frequencies that have traditional backing but limited research?

We stay curious without being gullible.

We try low-risk approaches whilst keeping expectations realistic.

We trust what we observe in our own homes more than what marketing claims tell us should happen.

The sensible approach isn't wholesale rejection or uncritical acceptance. It's exploration with clear eyes.

Some families find solfeggio frequencies become valuable parts of their calming toolkit. Others try them and move on to what fits better.

Both outcomes are fine.

What matters isn't what should work according to ancient tradition or trendy wellness claims. What matters is what helps your child.

The research will catch up eventually. Until then, we navigate with the evidence we have—including the evidence of our own observations.

Why do parents keep using solfeggio frequencies with their children when the evidence is thin?

I asked this after reviewing the research. The gap between claims and proof is real.

But the answer makes practical sense:

**The ritual matters**

Children—especially neurodivergent children—thrive with predictable routines. Playing the same calming frequency at the same time each day creates a reliable signal: "Now we rest."

The frequency itself may matter less than the consistency. But if 396 Hz becomes associated with calm moments, that association becomes powerful.

**The placebo isn't nothing**

When parents tell me their child seems calmer after listening to specific frequencies, I believe them. Something real is happening.

Whether it's the specific tone, the ritual, the parent's calmer state, or all of these together—the effect is genuine even if the mechanism is uncertain.

For exhausted parents, something that helps is something that helps. You don't always need to know exactly why.

**Low risk, potential benefit**

Unlike many approaches, solfeggio frequencies carry virtually no risk when used at reasonable volumes. No side effects. No interactions. No expense beyond access to the sounds.

When something is low risk and some parents find benefit, it's reasonable to explore.

**Passive listening advantage**

Here's why these frequencies can work well for ND children: they require nothing. No interaction. No response. No engagement.

For children who struggle with demand avoidance or find active approaches overwhelming, this passive quality removes barriers.

No demands. No pressure. Just sound.

The honest position: specific claims about solfeggio frequencies outpace the evidence. But the broader principle—that sound affects our physiology—has research support.

Try if you're curious. Watch what happens. Keep expectations realistic. Trust what you observe in your own home.

That's the evidence-informed approach that actually serves families.
