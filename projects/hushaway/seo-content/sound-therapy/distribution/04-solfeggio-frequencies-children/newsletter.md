# Newsletter Snippet: Solfeggio Frequencies for Children

## Hook

You've seen the claims. 528 Hz heals DNA. 432 Hz aligns you with the universe. Ancient frequencies can transform your child.

If you're somewhere between curious and sceptical, you're exactly where you should be.

## Body

Here's what we found after digging through the research on solfeggio frequencies for children: the specific claims outpace the evidence. The grand promises don't hold up under scrutiny.

But that doesn't mean these sounds are useless.

The most studied frequency (528 Hz, the "love frequency") shows measurable effects on stress markers in adults. Small studies. Preliminary. But something is there. Child-specific research? Almost nonexistent. The DNA repair claims, universal alignment promises, and specific healing effects? No scientific support.

Yet many parents find real value in these frequencies. Not because of mystical properties, but because of how children respond to predictable calming rituals, passive listening that requires nothing from them, and low-risk exploration when you're exhausted and looking for anything that might help.

Some neurodivergent children show strong positive responses to specific tones—deeply calming in ways that neurotypical children don't experience. Others are sensitive in uncomfortable ways. Both responses are valid.

## CTA

The sensible approach is neither wholesale rejection nor uncritical acceptance. Try if you're curious. Watch what happens. Keep expectations realistic.
