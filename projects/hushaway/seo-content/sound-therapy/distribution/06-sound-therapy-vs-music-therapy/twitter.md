# Twitter/X Content: Sound Therapy vs Music Therapy

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your child struggled in music therapy.

That doesn't mean sound won't help them.

The difference between music therapy and sound therapy might explain everything.

🧵 Thread:

### Tweet 2
1. Music therapy = ACTIVE engagement

Sessions with a therapist. Instruments. Participation. Structure.

Your child responds, creates, interacts.

It's brilliant. But it requires capacity.

### Tweet 3
2. Sound therapy = PASSIVE listening

Press play. Your child receives the sounds. No demands. No responses expected.

It works whether or not they're consciously listening.

3. Why this matters for ND kids:

Think about your child at their most overwhelmed. Mid-meltdown. End of school day.

Can they follow instructions in that moment? Participate in anything?

Most can't. The tank is empty.

4. Music therapy needs something left in the tank

Your child needs enough regulation to:
- Participate in the session
- Follow the therapist's guidance
- Respond to musical cues

On a hard day, that capacity just isn't there.

5. Sound therapy asks nothing

Your child can:
- Lie in bed
- Sit in a car seat
- Curl up on the sofa
- Hide under a blanket

The sounds work anyway. No performance required.

6. The evidence picture

Music therapy: stronger research base, decades of studies

Sound therapy: newer, more mixed evidence

But "more evidence" ≠ "better for YOUR child"

Choose based on capacity, not research volume.

### Tweet 8
7. You can use BOTH

Music therapy weekly for structured work when your child has capacity.

Sound therapy daily for regulation, crisis moments, and the gaps between sessions.

They're complementary, not competing.

### Tweet 9
8. The real question

What does your child need RIGHT NOW?

Not where you hope they'll be in 6 months. Today.

If they can't engage, start with what asks nothing of them.

### Tweet 10 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Music therapy = active, needs capacity
• Sound therapy = passive, asks nothing
• Different jobs, both valuable
• Choose based on your child's needs
• You can use both

If music therapy didn't work, don't give up on sound. Try a different approach.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Music therapy didn't work for your child?

That doesn't mean sound won't help.

Active engagement vs passive listening = completely different approaches.

One asks something of your child. The other asks nothing at all.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

"More evidence" doesn't mean "better for your child."

Music therapy has stronger research. But if your child can't engage right now, an approach that requires nothing of them might still help.

Meet them where they are.

### Tweet C (List)
5 signs sound therapy might work when music therapy didn't:

• Your child is already overwhelmed
• They can't engage with active approaches
• Previous therapy felt like one more demand
• They need support at 2am
• They struggle during transitions

Sometimes passive is better.

### Tweet D (Question)
For parents of ND kids:

Did you try music therapy? How did it go?

Genuinely curious about your experiences. Reply with what worked (or didn't).

### Tweet E (Parent Reality)
Your child at bedtime: racing thoughts, can't settle, already exhausted from the day

Music therapist: "Let's play instruments and explore rhythms together"

That's the capacity gap.

Passive sound therapy fills it. No demands. Just press play.
