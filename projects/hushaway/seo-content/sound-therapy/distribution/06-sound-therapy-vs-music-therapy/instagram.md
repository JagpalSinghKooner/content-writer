# Instagram Content: Sound Therapy vs Music Therapy

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
**Music therapy didn't work?**

**Sound therapy might.**

[Large, bold text - high contrast colours]

### Slide 2: The Problem
Most parents don't realize these are completely different approaches.

One asks something of your child.

The other asks nothing at all.

### Slide 3: Music Therapy
**Active engagement**

↓ Sessions with a therapist
↓ Instruments and participation
↓ Structured activities
↓ Requires capacity

### Slide 4: Sound Therapy
**Passive listening**

↓ Press play
↓ No demands
↓ No responses expected
↓ Works when overwhelmed

### Slide 5: The Capacity Gap
Think about your child at bedtime.

Racing thoughts. Already exhausted.

Can they participate in anything right now?

Passive approaches fill this gap.

### Slide 6: When Music Therapy Works
✓ Your child has capacity to engage
✓ They enjoy making music
✓ Structure helps them
✓ They connect well with adults

### Slide 7: When Sound Therapy Works
✓ Your child is already overwhelmed
✓ They can't engage right now
✓ It's 2am and nothing else works
✓ Previous therapy felt like too much

### Slide 8: Can You Use Both?
**Yes.**

Music therapy for structured work when your child has capacity.

Sound therapy for daily regulation and crisis moments.

### Slide 9: The Real Question
What does your child need RIGHT NOW?

Not in 6 months. Today.

Meet them where they are.

## Caption

Your child tried music therapy. It didn't work. Now you're wondering if sound-based approaches just aren't for your family.

.
.
.

Here's what nobody told you: they're completely different approaches.

Music therapy is active. Sessions with a therapist. Instruments. Participation. It's brilliant and evidence-based. But it requires capacity. Your child needs something left in the tank to engage.

Sound therapy is passive. Press play. Your child receives the sounds. No demands. No performance. No responses expected. It works whether or not they're consciously listening.

Think about your child at their most overwhelmed. Mid-meltdown. End of the school day when everything feels like too much. Bedtime when their racing brain won't switch off.

Can they follow instructions in those moments? Participate in anything at all?

For most neurodivergent children, the answer is no. When the tank is empty, there's nothing left to give. That's when passive approaches work. They ask nothing of your child. Nothing of you.

If music therapy didn't quite fit, it doesn't mean you failed. It doesn't mean your child failed. It might just mean they needed something different. Something that met them in their struggle instead of asking them to rise above it.

Sound therapy is passive. Press play. No demands. No responses. Works when they're already overwhelmed.

One asks something of your child. The other asks nothing at all."
