# LinkedIn Content: Sound Therapy vs Music Therapy

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
**Your child struggled in music therapy.**

**That doesn't mean sound won't help them.**

Swipe → to learn the critical difference parents miss

### Slide 2: The Real Difference
**Music therapy = Active engagement**
Sessions with a therapist. Instruments. Participation. Structure.

**Sound therapy = Passive listening**
Press play. No demands. No responses. Just sounds.

### Slide 3: Why This Matters
When your child is overwhelmed, can they follow instructions?

Most neurodivergent children can't. The tank is empty.

Music therapy needs capacity. Sound therapy asks nothing.

### Slide 4: Music Therapy Works When...
✓ Your child has capacity to engage
✓ They benefit from relationships
✓ They enjoy making music
✓ They can attend regular sessions
✓ Structure helps them

### Slide 5: Sound Therapy Works When...
✓ Your child is already overwhelmed
✓ They can't engage right now
✓ It's 2am and nothing else is available
✓ Previous therapy felt like too much
✓ They need support during transitions

### Slide 6: The Evidence Picture
Music therapy has stronger research backing. More studies, more rigorous methodology.

Sound therapy research is newer and more mixed.

But "more evidence" ≠ "better for your child."

### Slide 7: Can You Use Both?
Absolutely.

Music therapy when your child has capacity for structured work.

Sound therapy for daily regulation, crisis moments, and the gaps between sessions.

### Slide 8: The Real Question
What does your child need RIGHT NOW?

Not in 6 months. Today. This moment.

If they can't engage, start with what asks nothing of them.

### Slide 9: Summary
Quick recap:

1. Different approaches, different jobs
2. Active engagement vs passive listening
3. Both have value
4. Choose based on your child's capacity
5. You can use both

## Text Post 1

Your child tried music therapy. It didn't work. Now you're wondering if anything sound-based will ever help.

Here's what nobody tells you: they're completely different approaches.

**Music therapy = active engagement**
Sessions with a therapist. Instruments to hold. Rhythms to follow. Your child responds and participates. It requires capacity.

**Sound therapy = passive listening**
Your child lies in bed with headphones on. Nothing happens. No instructions. No responses expected. Just sounds working while their nervous system settles.

Think about your child at their most overwhelmed. Mid-meltdown. End of the school day when everything feels like too much. Bedtime when their brain won't switch off.

Can they follow instructions in those moments? Respond to prompts? Participate in anything at all?

For most neurodivergent children, the answer is no. And that's not a failing. When the tank is empty, there's nothing left to give.

Music therapy works brilliantly for many children. But it needs capacity. Sound therapy asks nothing.

If your child struggled with music therapy sessions, it doesn't mean you failed. It doesn't mean they failed.

It might just mean they needed something that required less of them. Something that met them in their struggle instead of asking them to rise above it.

That's the difference. And it changes everything.

## Text Post 2

After 7 years running a nursery and now as a sound therapy practitioner, I've seen this pattern dozens of times:

A parent tries music therapy for their neurodivergent child. The sessions don't quite work. They assume sound-based approaches just aren't for their family.

But here's the thing they don't realize: music therapy and sound therapy do completely different jobs.

Music therapy is brilliant. It's evidence-based, relationship-focused, and helps many children develop communication and social skills.

But it requires something of your child: the capacity to engage. On a good day, that might be there. On a hard day, it might not.

Sound therapy (the passive listening kind, not practitioner-led sessions) removes that barrier completely.

No demands. No performance. No relationship to maintain. Just press play.

For a child who's already running on empty, that difference is everything.

I've worked with families who use both. Music therapy weekly for structured goal work. Sound therapy daily for regulation support. The music therapy session builds skills. The sound therapy at home fills the gaps when the therapist isn't there.

They're not competing. They're complementary.

If music therapy didn't work for your child, don't give up on sound. You might just need a different approach. One that asks nothing of them at all.

Sometimes the kindest thing is to stop asking anything of them. Even gentle demands.

Have you tried both approaches? What worked for your family?
