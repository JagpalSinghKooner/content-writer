# Newsletter Snippet: Sound Therapy vs Music Therapy

## Hook

Your child tried music therapy. The sessions felt like one more demand on an already overwhelmed child. Now you're wondering if anything sound-based will ever work.

Here's what nobody told you: music therapy and sound therapy aren't the same thing. Not even close.

## Body

Music therapy is active. Sessions with a therapist. Instruments to hold. Rhythms to follow. Your child participates, responds, creates. It's evidence-based and helps many children beautifully. But it requires capacity—something your child might not have at the end of a hard day.

Sound therapy is passive. Press play. Your child receives the sounds. No demands. No responses expected. No performance. Just sounds washing over them while their nervous system settles.

Think about your child at their most overwhelmed. Mid-meltdown. Bedtime when their brain won't switch off. In those moments, can they follow instructions? Participate in anything at all?

For most neurodivergent children, the answer is no. When the tank is empty, there's nothing left to give. That's when passive approaches work. They ask nothing of your child. Nothing of you.

## CTA

If music therapy didn't quite fit your family, it doesn't mean you failed. It doesn't mean your child failed. It might just mean they needed something different.

• How to choose based on your child's needs right now
• Why you can use both together

If previous therapy sessions felt like one more demand on an already stretched child, this article might explain why.
