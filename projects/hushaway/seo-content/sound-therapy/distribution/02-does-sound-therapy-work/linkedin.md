# LinkedIn Content: Does Sound Therapy Actually Work?

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
Does sound therapy actually work?

(The honest answer surprised us too)

Swipe → to see what the research really says

### Slide 2: The Problem
Most websites selling sound therapy won't tell you this:

The evidence base is mixed.

Some approaches have solid research. Others have almost none.

You deserve to know the difference.

### Slide 3: Music Therapy - Strong Evidence
✓ Gold standard research (Cochrane Review)
✓ 26 studies, 1,000+ participants
✓ Improvements in social interaction and communication

The catch? Requires a trained therapist and active participation.

Not the same as pressing play at bedtime.

### Slide 4: Binaural Beats - Limited But Interesting
✓ Studies show promise for working memory
✓ Changes brain connectivity patterns
✓ Safe and non-invasive

The honest part? Most studies are on adults. Research on children is limited.

### Slide 5: Expensive Programmes - Weak Evidence
Auditory Integration Training and Tomatis cost £1,200-£2,000.

The evidence? A Cochrane Review found limited benefit compared to control groups.

Individual responses vary. But with limited funds, you deserve to know.

### Slide 6: What About Daily Calming Sounds?
Here's the thing.

They haven't been extensively studied because no one funds research into "playing gentle sounds at bedtime."

But that doesn't mean they don't help real families every night.

### Slide 7: Two Types of Evidence
Research tells us what works on average across populations.

Parent experience tells us what works for individual children in real homes.

Both matter.

### Slide 8: The Real Question
It's not just "does sound therapy work according to clinical trials?"

It's also "does this specific sound help my specific child right now?"

### Slide 9: Our Honest Answer
Sound therapy isn't magic. It won't cure anything. It probably won't transform your child overnight.

But the right sounds, used consistently, can become part of a regulation toolkit that genuinely helps.

## Text Post 1

You've searched this question before. Probably late at night, after another bedtime that left you exhausted.

Does sound therapy work? Really?

Here's what we found after reviewing dozens of studies.

**Approaches with solid evidence:**
• Music therapy (with a trained therapist) - Cochrane Review backs this up
• Safe and Sound Protocol - emerging evidence, practitioner-required

**Approaches with promising but limited evidence:**
• Binaural beats - mostly adult studies, but interesting results
• General calming soundscapes - intuitive but understudied

**Approaches with weak evidence despite bold claims:**
• Auditory Integration Training (AIT)
• Tomatis Method (£1,200-£2,000 with minimal research support)

The most honest answer?

Some approaches do work. Some don't. And the only way to know what works for your child is to try.

What about daily calming sounds for bedtime? They haven't been extensively studied because no one funds research into "playing gentle sounds at bedtime."

But that doesn't mean they don't help real families every night.

Research tells us what works on average across populations. Parent experience tells us what works for individual children in real homes.

Both types of evidence matter.

Have you tried sound therapy with your child? What's been your experience?

Most websites selling sound therapy won't tell you this.

The evidence base is mixed. Some approaches have solid research behind them. Others have almost none.

After spending hours reviewing the actual studies, here's what surprised us:

**What has strong research backing:**
Music therapy. A Cochrane Review analysed 26 studies with over 1,000 autistic participants. It found moderate to strong evidence for improving social interaction and communication.

The catch? It requires a trained therapist and active participation from your child.

**What's interesting but under-researched:**
Binaural beats. Studies show they can improve working memory and change brain connectivity patterns. But most research is on adults. Paediatric studies are limited.

That doesn't mean they don't work for children. It means we can't point to large-scale studies proving they do.

**What has weak evidence despite high costs:**
Auditory Integration Training and Tomatis Method. These programmes cost £1,200-£2,000. But a Cochrane Review found limited evidence of benefit compared to control groups.

The research doesn't strongly support these expensive programmes.

**What about calming sounds at bedtime?**
They haven't been extensively studied. But here's the thing.

Sound therapy doesn't need a published study to help your child settle. If calming sounds help your child fall asleep faster, that's valuable.

The question isn't just "does sound therapy work according to clinical trials?"

It's also "does this specific sound help my specific child right now?"

Research captures one type of evidence. Parent experience captures another.

Both matter.
