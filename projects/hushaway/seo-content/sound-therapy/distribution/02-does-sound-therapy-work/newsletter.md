# Newsletter Snippet: Does Sound Therapy Actually Work?

## Hook

You've searched this question before. Probably late at night, after another bedtime that left you exhausted. Does sound therapy work? Really?

## Body

Here's what most websites selling sound therapy won't tell you: the evidence base is mixed. Some approaches have solid research behind them. Others have almost none.

After reviewing dozens of studies, here's what we found. Music therapy has strong evidence (Cochrane Reviews back this up). The Safe and Sound Protocol shows promise but needs larger trials. Binaural beats are interesting but mostly studied in adults. And expensive programmes like Auditory Integration Training? They cost £1,200-£2,000 with weak evidence.

What about daily calming sounds for bedtime? They haven't been extensively studied because no one funds research into "playing gentle sounds at bedtime." But that doesn't mean they don't help real families every night.

The most honest answer we can give you: some approaches do work, some don't, and the only way to know what works for your child is to try.
