## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
DOES SOUND THERAPY
ACTUALLY WORK?

The honest answer
(swipe to find out)

### Slide 2: The Truth
Most websites won't tell you this:

The evidence base is mixed.

Some approaches have solid research.
Others have almost none.

### Slide 3: Music Therapy
✓ Strong Evidence

Cochrane Review:
26 studies, 1,000+ participants

Improves social interaction
and communication

Requires trained therapist

### Slide 4: Binaural Beats
? Limited Evidence

Studies show promise
(working memory, brain connectivity)

But most research is on adults

Still safe and worth trying

### Slide 5: Expensive Programmes
✗ Weak Evidence

AIT & Tomatis:
£1,200-£2,000

Cochrane Review found
limited benefit

### Slide 6: Daily Calming Sounds
Understudied but helpful

No one funds research on
"playing gentle sounds at bedtime"

But parents report it helps
every single night

### Slide 7: Two Types of Evidence
Research:
What works on average

Parent experience:
What works for YOUR child

Both matter.

### Slide 8: The Real Question
It's not just:
"Does it work in clinical trials?"

It's also:
"Does this sound help
MY child right now?"

### Slide 9: Our Honest Answer
Sound therapy isn't magic.

But the right sounds, used consistently,
can become part of a regulation toolkit
that genuinely helps.

### Slide 10: What to Do
Start simple.
Try gentle soundscapes.

Observe your child.
Notice what resonates.

Be patient.
Consistent use matters.

Trust yourself.
You know your child best.

Does sound therapy actually work? You've probably searched this late at night, after another exhausting bedtime.

.
.
.

Here's what most websites won't tell you.

The evidence base is mixed. Music therapy has strong research backing it up (Cochrane Reviews with over 1,000 participants). Binaural beats show promise but are mostly studied in adults. And those expensive programmes costing £1,200-£2,000? Weak evidence.

What about daily calming sounds for bedtime? They haven't been extensively studied because no one funds research into "playing gentle sounds at bedtime." But that doesn't mean they don't help real families every night.

The most honest answer? Some approaches do work. Some don't. And the only way to know what works for your child is to try.

Research tells us what works on average across populations. Parent experience tells us what works for individual children in real homes. Both types of evidence matter.

Sound therapy doesn't need a published study to help your child settle. If calming sounds help your child fall asleep faster, that's valuable.

The question isn't just "does sound therapy work according to clinical trials?" It's also "does this specific sound help my specific child right now?"

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Does sound therapy actually work? Let me tell you what most websites won't."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"The evidence base is wildly mixed.

Music therapy? Strong research. Cochrane Reviews back it up.

Binaural beats? Interesting studies, but mostly on adults.

Those expensive programmes costing £2,000? Weak evidence.

Daily calming sounds for bedtime? Understudied. But parents report they help every single night.

Here's the thing: research tells us what works on average. Parent experience tells us what works for YOUR child.

Both matter."
