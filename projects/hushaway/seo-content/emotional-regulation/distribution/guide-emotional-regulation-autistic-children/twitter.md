# Twitter/X Content: Emotional Regulation for Autistic Children

## Thread (12 tweets)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Standard emotional regulation advice is failing your autistic child.

Not because you're doing it wrong. Because the strategies were built for a different kind of brain.

Here's what actually works:

### Tweet 2
You've tried:
• Breathing exercises
• Calm-down corners
• Talking through feelings
• Movement strategies

None of it works during the moment that matters.

Here's why.

---

### Tweet 3
Standard strategies demand exactly what overwhelmed autistic children can't give:

❌ Following verbal instructions
❌ Making decisions
❌ Cognitive engagement
❌ Body awareness

It's like asking someone to solve a maths problem while their house is on fire.

Autistic nervous systems work differently:

• Emotions arrive faster and BIGGER
• Recovery takes longer (stress hormones hang around)
• Sensory input compounds everything
• Every demand adds cognitive load

This isn't a character flaw. It's neurology.

---

### Tweet 5
Breathing exercises require:
- Understanding verbal instructions
- Sustained attention
- Body awareness
- Cognitive capacity to count

During overwhelm, your child's verbal processing is COMPROMISED. These demands become impossible.

---

### Tweet 6
Calm-down corners with multiple options require:
- Decision-making (which item?)
- Fine motor control
- Cognitive flexibility

Choice-making uses the prefrontal cortex. That's precisely the part that goes offline during intense stress.

So what's left?

**The zero-demand approach:**

✓ Stop talking (or minimise to "I'm here")
✓ Reduce sensory input where possible
✓ Provide passive support (like sound)
✓ Don't require any engagement
✓ Just wait

---

### Tweet 8
Why passive sound works:

1. Bypasses cognitive processing (automatic)
2. Provides predictable sensory input
3. Requires zero effort
4. Works from a distance
5. Regulates both of you

Your child doesn't need to engage. The auditory system processes it automatically.

### Tweet 9
The uncomfortable truth:

Strategies that feel like you're "doing nothing" are often most effective.

You're not doing nothing. You're reducing demands whilst providing passive sensory support.

That's actually doing quite a lot.

---

### Tweet 10
Common question: "Won't my child never learn to self-regulate if I just reduce demands?"

Opposite is true.

Self-regulation builds from co-regulation. Pushing skills during crisis doesn't teach regulation. It teaches that support isn't available when things are hardest.

---

### Tweet 11
Build skills BETWEEN crises:
- Practise strategies when calm
- Build sensory tolerance gradually
- Develop emotional vocabulary through play

But during the crisis? Meet them where they are. That's how nervous systems learn the pathway from distress to calm.

---

### Tweet 12 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Standard advice assumes neurotypical processing
• Autistic children need zero-demand support during crisis
• Passive strategies (like sound) work automatically
• Build skills between crises, not during
• You're not doing it wrong—you need different tools

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

"Doing nothing" during your autistic child's meltdown is often the most effective strategy.

You're not doing nothing. You're reducing demands whilst providing passive support.

Stop adding cognitive load when their system is already overwhelmed.

---

### Tweet B (Insight)
After-school meltdowns aren't about what happened in the last 5 minutes.

They're about EVERYTHING that came before.

Your autistic child spent the day masking, managing sensory chaos, meeting social expectations.

By home time, regulatory capacity is exhausted.

Expect nothing for the first hour.

---

### Tweet C (List)
5 demands hidden in "helpful" regulation strategies:

1. Breathing exercises → verbal processing + counting
2. Calm corners → decision-making + fine motor
3. Talking feelings → language processing + interoception
4. Movement strategies → motor planning + body awareness
5. Choices → prefrontal cortex function

All impossible during overwhelm.

---

### Tweet D (Question)
Why do breathing exercises work for neurotypical children but fail for autistic children during meltdowns?

Because autistic nervous systems experience emotions more intensely and verbal processing goes offline during overwhelm.

You're asking a disabled function to do heavy lifting.

---

### Tweet E (Proof)
We've been told autistic children need to "learn coping skills."

But research shows autistic individuals experience emotions more intensely and have fewer automatic coping strategies during distress.

The problem isn't lack of skills. It's demands that exceed capacity.

Different nervous system = different support needed.
