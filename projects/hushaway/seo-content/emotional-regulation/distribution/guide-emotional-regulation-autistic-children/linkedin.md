# LinkedIn Content: Emotional Regulation for Autistic Children

## Carousel (8 slides)

### Slide 1: Hook
**Why standard regulation advice fails your autistic child**

(And what actually works instead)

Swipe → to learn the zero-demand approach

---

### Slide 2: The Problem
**You've tried everything:**

Breathing exercises
Calm-down corners
Talking through feelings
Movement strategies

None of it works during the moment that matters.

---

### Slide 3: Why They Fail
**Standard strategies demand exactly what overwhelmed autistic children can't give:**

❌ Following verbal instructions
❌ Making decisions
❌ Cognitive engagement
❌ Body awareness

Their processing capacity is already gone.

---

### Slide 4: The Reality
**Autistic nervous systems work differently:**

• Emotions arrive faster and bigger
• Recovery takes longer
• Sensory input compounds everything
• Demands make things worse

This isn't a character flaw. It's neurology.

---

### Slide 5: The Zero-Demand Alternative
**Stop requiring anything from your child during crisis:**

✓ Minimal talking
✓ Reduced sensory input
✓ Passive support (like sound)
✓ No engagement demands
✓ Just wait

---

### Slide 6: Why Sound Works
**Passive sound bypasses all the barriers:**

• No cognitive processing required
• Predictable sensory input to anchor to
• Zero effort from your child
• Works from a distance
• Regulates both of you

---

### Slide 7: Quick Recap
What actually helps:

1. Reduce baseline demands daily
2. Create predictability
3. Stop talking during crisis
4. Provide passive sensory support
5. Wait (recovery takes time)

You've tried the breathing exercises.

The calm-down corner with fidget toys.

The books. The apps. The advice from well-meaning relatives.

None of it works for your autistic child. Not during the moment that matters.

Here's what nobody told you:

Generic emotional regulation strategies are designed for neurotypical nervous systems. They assume your child can follow verbal instructions during distress. They assume your child can make choices when overwhelmed. They assume sensory input isn't already pushing them past capacity.

For autistic children, these assumptions don't apply. That's why the advice keeps failing.

But here's the truth: you're not doing it wrong. You've just been given tools built for a different kind of brain.

What actually helps during autism emotional overwhelm:

1. **Stop talking** (or minimise to bare essentials like "I'm here")

2. **Reduce sensory input** where possible—dim lights, quieter space

3. **Provide passive support** like playing familiar, calming sounds that require zero engagement

4. **Don't demand anything** in return—no eye contact, no responses, no acknowledgment needed

5. **Wait** (recovery takes longer than you think, and trying to speed it up typically backfires)

The zero-demand approach isn't lazy. It's respecting your child's neurology. It's actually paying attention to what they need.

Passive strategies like sound work because they bypass all the cognitive demands. Your child doesn't need to understand, follow, or choose. The auditory system processes sound automatically.

Permission to do it differently?

Your autistic child isn't a neurotypical child who needs more practice. They're a child with a fundamentally different nervous system who needs different support.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

Have you found strategies that work for your child? I'd love to hear what's helped in your family.

After-school meltdowns.

If you're a parent of an autistic child, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

Your child held it together all day at school. They masked. They managed the sensory chaos. They met social expectations. They followed instructions.

Then they get home—the one place they feel safe—and everything falls apart.

Here's what's happening:

The meltdown isn't about what happened in the last five minutes. It's about everything that came before. Every transition. Every unexpected change. Every loud noise. Every social demand. Every bit of sensory input they had to filter.

By home time, their regulatory capacity is completely exhausted.

This is accumulated demand overload. And standard regulation strategies don't account for it.

What helps instead:

**Before school:**
Build in predictability wherever possible. Visual schedules. Warnings before transitions. Consistent routines.

**During school:**
Work with teachers on reducing unnecessary demands. Does your child really need to look at the teacher? Do they need to sit completely still?

**After school:**
Expect nothing for the first hour. Dim lights. Minimal talking. Play familiar, calming sounds. Let them decompress without demands.

**Long-term:**
Audit daily life for hidden stressors. What can become more sensory-friendly? More predictable?

The goal isn't to make your child "cope better" with overwhelming environments. The goal is to reduce the overwhelm before it compounds.

One quiet moment after school can change the whole evening for your family.

What does your after-school routine look like? What's helped your child transition from school to home?
