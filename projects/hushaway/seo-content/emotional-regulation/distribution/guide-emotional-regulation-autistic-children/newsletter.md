# Newsletter Snippet: Emotional Regulation for Autistic Children

## Hook

You've tried the breathing exercises, the calm-down corner, the books, the apps. None of it works for your autistic child—not during the moment that matters. Here's what nobody told you about why generic regulation advice keeps failing.

## Body

Standard emotional regulation strategies are designed for neurotypical nervous systems. They assume your child can follow verbal instructions during distress, make choices when overwhelmed, and that sensory input isn't already pushing them past capacity.

For autistic children, these assumptions simply don't apply. That's why the advice keeps failing you.

The uncomfortable truth? Every "helpful" strategy demands exactly what your overwhelmed child can't give. Breathing exercises require verbal processing and cognitive capacity. Calm-down corners require decision-making. Talking through feelings requires language processing. During autism emotional overwhelm, these cognitive functions are compromised or offline entirely.

What actually helps is the opposite: the zero-demand approach. Stop talking (or minimise to "I'm here"). Reduce sensory input where possible. Provide passive support like familiar, calming sounds that require zero engagement. Don't demand responses. Just wait—recovery takes longer than you think.

Passive sound works because it bypasses all these barriers. Your child doesn't need to understand it, follow it, or choose it. The auditory system processes sound automatically, providing predictable sensory input to anchor to when everything else feels overwhelming.

You're not doing it wrong. You've just been given tools built for a different kind of brain.
