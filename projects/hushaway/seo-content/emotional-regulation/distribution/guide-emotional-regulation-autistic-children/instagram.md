# Instagram Content: Emotional Regulation for Autistic Children

## Carousel (10 slides)

### Slide 1: Cover
**Why your autistic child's regulation strategies aren't working**

(It's not your fault)

[Bold text, high contrast—calming colours like soft blue/cream]

---

### Slide 2: The Setup
**You've tried everything:**

Breathing exercises ✗
Calm-down corners ✗
Talking through feelings ✗
Movement strategies ✗

None of it works during the moment that matters.

---

### Slide 3: The Truth
**Standard strategies were built for neurotypical brains**

They assume:
• Following verbal instructions during distress
• Making decisions when overwhelmed
• Sensory input isn't at capacity

For autistic children, these assumptions don't apply.

---

### Slide 4: Why They Fail
**Every "helpful" strategy adds demands:**

Breathing → verbal processing + counting
Calm corner → decision-making + fine motor
Talking → language processing
Movement → motor planning + body awareness

During overwhelm, these functions are compromised.

---

### Slide 5: The Reality
**Autistic nervous systems work differently:**

→ Emotions arrive faster and BIGGER
→ Recovery takes longer
→ Sensory input compounds everything
→ Demands make things worse

This isn't a character flaw. It's neurology.

---

### Slide 6: The Zero-Demand Approach
**What actually helps:**

✓ Stop talking (or minimal: "I'm here")
✓ Reduce sensory input
✓ Provide passive support
✓ Don't require engagement
✓ Just wait

Recovery takes time.

---

### Slide 7: Why Sound Works
**Passive sound bypasses the barriers:**

• No cognitive processing required
• Predictable sensory input to anchor to
• Zero effort from your child
• Works from a distance
• Regulates both of you

---

### Slide 8: After-School Meltdowns
**They're not about the last 5 minutes**

Your child spent the day:
→ Masking
→ Managing sensory chaos
→ Meeting social expectations
→ Following instructions

By home time, regulatory capacity is exhausted.

---

### Slide 9: Permission
**You're not doing it wrong**

Your autistic child isn't a neurotypical child who needs more practice.

They're a child with a fundamentally different nervous system who needs different support.

Passive strategies aren't lazy. They're neurology-respecting.

---

### Slide 10: CTA

## Caption

You've tried the breathing exercises. The calm-down corner. The books, the apps, the advice from everyone.

None of it works for your autistic child. Not during the moment that matters.

.
.
.

Here's what nobody told you: generic emotional regulation strategies are designed for neurotypical nervous systems. They assume your child can follow verbal instructions during distress. They assume your child can make choices when overwhelmed. They assume sensory input isn't already pushing them past capacity.

For autistic children, these assumptions simply don't apply.

But here's the truth: you're not doing it wrong. You've just been given tools built for a different kind of brain.

What actually helps is the zero-demand approach. Stop talking (or minimise to bare essentials). Reduce sensory input where possible. Provide passive support like familiar, calming sounds. Don't demand engagement. Just wait—recovery takes longer than you think.

Passive sound works because it bypasses all the cognitive demands. Your child doesn't need to understand, follow, or choose. The auditory system processes sound automatically.

Permission to do it differently? Your autistic child isn't a neurotypical child who needs more practice. They're a child with a fundamentally different nervous system who needs different support.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Stop trying to teach your autistic child breathing exercises during a meltdown."

[Visual: Parent looking exhausted, child in distress]

---

**[3-22 seconds: VALUE]**
"Here's why it doesn't work:

During overwhelm, their verbal processing is compromised. Decision-making goes offline. Cognitive capacity disappears.

You're asking a disabled function to do heavy lifting.

What works instead? The zero-demand approach:
• Stop talking
• Reduce sensory input
• Play calming sounds
• Don't require ANY engagement

Passive sound works because it bypasses all the barriers."

[Visual: Parent pressing play on device, calm environment, child gradually settling]

---

**[22-30 seconds: CTA]**
"Your child isn't broken. They just need different support.

Follow for more autism strategies that actually work."

[Visual: Text overlay "One quiet moment can change a whole day" + HushAway handle]
