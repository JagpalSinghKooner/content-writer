# Instagram Content: Emotional Regulation for ADHD Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
ADHD EMOTIONAL REGULATION ISN'T BROKEN

It's just wired differently

[Bold text on calming background - high contrast]

### Slide 2: The Light Switch Reality
Neurotypical kids:
Dimmer switch
(gradual emotional build)

ADHD kids:
Light switch someone else controls
(instant full intensity)

This isn't a discipline problem.
It's neurology.

### Slide 3: Why Deep Breathing Fails
"Take a deep breath" requires:

✗ Noticing you're dysregulated
✗ Remembering the technique
✗ Sustained attention
✗ Waiting for results

ADHD impairs ALL of these.

### Slide 4: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria
What you say:
"That didn't quite work."

What they hear:
"You're not good enough."

The emotional pain is REAL.
As intense as physical pain.

They're not being dramatic.

### Slide 5: What Actually Works
Tools that don't require thinking:

✓ Immediate sensory input
✓ Passive sound
✓ Movement BEFORE talk
✓ Fewer words, more presence

### Slide 6: Immediate Sensory Input
• Cold water on face/wrists
• Strong flavours (sour sweets)
• Carrying something heavy
• Wall pushes

These bypass struggling executive function.

### Slide 7: Movement First
During a meltdown:

Movement discharges adrenaline

30 seconds of jumping
= more effective than
10 minutes of talking

Move first. Calm follows.

### Slide 8: Fewer Words
Reduce to:

"I'm here."
"You're safe."
"I'll wait."

Then stop talking.

Your presence does more than your words.

### Slide 9: The Sleep Foundation
Poor sleep = reduced emotional capacity

ADHD children often struggle with sleep

They start each day with LESS capacity

Fix sleep first.
Everything else gets easier.

## Caption

Your ADHD child melts down over the "wrong" breakfast cereal.

.
.
.

You've tried deep breathing. Calm-down jars. Counting to ten. Nothing works.

Here's what nobody told you: emotional regulation for ADHD children isn't the same as for neurotypical kids. Not slower to develop. Fundamentally different.

Neurotypical kids have a dimmer switch for emotions. ADHD kids have a light switch someone else controls. Feelings flip to full intensity instantly.

The strategies that work for neurotypical children often make things worse for your ADHD child because they fight against how the ADHD brain actually processes feelings.

Standard advice assumes your child can notice they're getting dysregulated, remember a coping strategy, execute it with focus, and wait for it to work. ADHD challenges every single one of these.

What works instead? Tools that don't require thinking, remembering, or focusing:
• Immediate sensory input (cold water, strong flavours)
• Passive sound that enters without demanding attention
• Movement BEFORE conversation (discharge the adrenaline first)
• Fewer words, more presence

Your child isn't being difficult. Their brain genuinely can't use the strategies designed for neurotypical children. You're not doing it wrong. You're just using tools that weren't designed for your child's brain.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Stop telling ADHD kids to take a deep breath. Here's why it doesn't work."

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
"Deep breathing requires:
• Noticing you're dysregulated
• Remembering the technique
• Sustained attention
• Waiting for results

ADHD impairs ALL of these. You're asking them to use the exact brain functions that are offline.

What works instead?
• Cold water on wrists
• Movement before talking
• Passive sound
• Fewer words, more presence

These work WITH the ADHD brain, not against it."

**[20-30 seconds: CTA]**
"Your ADHD child isn't broken. They just need different tools.

Follow for more neurodivergent parenting strategies that actually work."

## Visual Notes

**Carousel Design:**
- Use calming colours (soft blues, gentle greens, warm neutrals)
- High contrast text (dark text on light background or reverse)
- Clean sans-serif font, large and readable
- Minimal design elements - no sensory overwhelm
- Consistent colour scheme across all slides

**Reel B-roll Suggestions:**
- Close-up of child's hands under running water
- Child doing wall pushes or jumping
- Parent sitting quietly near dysregulated child (showing presence)
- Sound playing passively in background (speaker/device visible)
- Visual contrast between chaos and calm moments

**Avoid:**
- Showing actual meltdowns (privacy and dignity)
- Overly busy designs
- Multiple fonts or colours
- Flashing or rapid transitions
