# Twitter/X Content: Emotional Regulation for ADHD Children

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
ADHD emotional regulation isn't broken.

It's wired differently.

Here's why standard parenting advice fails your ADHD child (and what actually works):

🧵 Thread:

### Tweet 2
1. THE LIGHT SWITCH REALITY

Neurotypical kids: dimmer switch (gradual emotional build-up)

ADHD kids: light switch someone else controls (instant full intensity)

This isn't a discipline problem. It's neurology.

### Tweet 3
2. WHY "TAKE A DEEP BREATH" FAILS

Deep breathing requires:
• Noticing you're dysregulated
• Remembering the technique
• Sustained attention
• Waiting for delayed results

ADHD impairs ALL of these.

You're asking for offline brain functions.

3. REJECTION SENSITIVE DYSPHORIA

Many ADHD children experience RSD: intense emotional pain in response to perceived rejection or criticism.

What feels like gentle correction to you can feel like crushing rejection to them.

The pain is real.

4. WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS

Tools that don't require thinking, remembering, or focusing:

• Immediate sensory input (cold water, strong flavours)
• Passive sound (no attention required)
• Movement BEFORE conversation
• Fewer words, more presence

### Tweet 6
5. THE SLEEP FOUNDATION

Poor sleep reduces emotional regulation capacity.

Since ADHD children often struggle with sleep, they start each day with less capacity.

Fix sleep first. Everything else gets easier.

### Tweet 7
6. MOVEMENT FIRST

During a meltdown, movement discharges adrenaline.

30 seconds of jumping or wall pushes does more than 10 minutes of talking.

Move first. Calm follows.

### Tweet 8
7. FEWER WORDS, MORE PRESENCE

During ADHD meltdowns, language processing becomes difficult.

Reduce to:
• "I'm here."
• "You're safe."
• "I'll wait."

Then stop talking. Your calm presence does more than your words.

### Tweet 9 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• ADHD emotions = light switch, not dimmer
• Standard strategies require offline brain functions
• Use immediate sensory input instead
• Movement before conversation
• Sleep is the foundation
• Fewer words, more presence

Stop fighting how ADHD works. Use tools designed for it.

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
ADHD emotional regulation is a light switch someone else controls.

Neurotypical kids have a dimmer switch (gradual build, time to intervene).

ADHD kids flip to full intensity instantly.

This isn't a discipline problem. It's wiring.

Tools that work for one won't work for the other.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

Telling an ADHD child to "take a deep breath" during a meltdown is asking them to use the exact brain functions that are offline.

It's like asking someone with a broken leg to run upstairs.

Stop using neurotypical tools for neurodivergent brains.

### Tweet C (List)
5 tools that actually work for ADHD emotional regulation:

• Cold water on face/wrists (immediate sensation)
• Movement before conversation (discharge adrenaline)
• Passive sound (no attention required)
• Strong flavours (sour sweets, mint)
• Fewer words, more presence

Which one would you try first?

### Tweet D (Question)
ADHD parents:

Has anyone ever told you to "just use a calm-down corner" or "teach them deep breathing" and you wanted to scream?

Standard emotional regulation advice is built for neurotypical kids.

Your ADHD child needs different tools. Not harder. Different.

### Tweet E (Proof)
Rejection sensitive dysphoria explains why your ADHD child falls apart over gentle correction.

What you say: "That didn't quite work."

What they hear: "You're not good enough."

The emotional pain is real. As intense as physical pain.

They're not being dramatic.
