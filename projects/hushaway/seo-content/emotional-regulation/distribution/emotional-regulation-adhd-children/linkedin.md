# LinkedIn Content: Emotional Regulation for ADHD Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
ADHD emotional regulation isn't broken.

It's just wired differently.

Swipe → to learn why standard advice fails (and what actually works)

### Slide 2: The Light Switch Reality
Neurotypical kids have a dimmer switch for emotions.

ADHD kids have a light switch someone else controls.

Feelings flip to full intensity instantly. No gradual build. No natural braking.

This isn't a discipline problem. It's neurology.

### Slide 3: Why Deep Breathing Fails
"Take a deep breath" requires:
- Noticing you're dysregulated
- Remembering the technique
- Sustained attention to execute it
- Waiting for delayed results

ADHD impairs ALL of these.

You're asking them to use the exact brain functions that are offline.

### Slide 4: Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria
Many ADHD children experience RSD: intense emotional pain in response to perceived rejection or criticism.

What feels like gentle correction to you can feel like crushing rejection to them.

They're not being dramatic. The pain is real.

### Slide 5: What Actually Works
Tools that don't require thinking, remembering, or focusing:

- Immediate sensory input (cold water, strong flavours)
- Passive sound (no attention required)
- Movement BEFORE conversation
- Fewer words, more presence

### Slide 6: The Sleep Foundation
Poor sleep reduces emotional regulation capacity.

Since ADHD children often struggle with sleep, they start each day with less capacity to manage emotions.

Fix sleep first. Everything else gets easier.

### Slide 7: Movement First
During a meltdown, movement discharges the adrenaline flooding their system.

30 seconds of jumping, wall pushes, or stomping can do more than 10 minutes of talking.

Move first. Calm follows.

### Slide 8: Summary
Quick recap:

1. ADHD emotions = light switch, not dimmer
2. Standard strategies require offline brain functions
3. Use immediate sensory input instead
4. Movement before conversation
5. Sleep is the foundation

Your ADHD child melts down over the "wrong" breakfast cereal.

You've tried deep breathing. Calm-down jars. Counting to ten.

Nothing works. And you're exhausted.

Here's what nobody told you:

Emotional regulation for ADHD children isn't the same as for neurotypical kids. Not slower to develop. Fundamentally different.

Think of neurotypical emotional regulation like a dimmer switch. The feeling rises gradually, and there's time to turn it down.

ADHD emotional regulation is a light switch someone else controls. Feelings flip to full intensity instantly. Your child has no hand on the switch.

The strategies that work for neurotypical children often make things worse because they fight against how the ADHD brain actually processes feelings.

Standard advice assumes your child can:
1. Notice they're becoming dysregulated (before the explosion)
2. Remember a coping strategy in the moment
3. Execute it with enough focus
4. Wait for the strategy to work

ADHD challenges every single one of these.

So what works?

Tools that don't require your child to think, remember, or focus:

• Immediate sensory input (cold water on wrists, strong flavours, heavy carrying)
• Passive sound that enters without demanding attention
• Movement BEFORE conversation (discharge the adrenaline first)
• Fewer words, more presence ("I'm here. You're safe. I'll wait.")

The key difference: these work WITH the ADHD brain instead of against it.

Your child isn't being difficult. Their brain genuinely can't use the strategies designed for neurotypical children.

Stop blaming yourself for struggles rooted in neurology. You're not doing it wrong. You're just using tools that weren't designed for your child's brain.

What's one ADHD parenting myth you wish people would stop repeating?

"Just take a deep breath."

We say this to dysregulated ADHD children constantly.

It almost never works. Here's why:

Deep breathing requires:
- Working memory (remembering to do it)
- Sustained attention (focusing on the technique)
- Interoception (noticing you're dysregulated)
- Delayed gratification (waiting 30 seconds for results)

ADHD impairs all four.

During a meltdown, you're asking your child to use the exact brain functions that are offline. It's like asking someone with a broken leg to run upstairs.

This isn't a parenting failure. It's a mismatch between the tool and the brain.

What works instead?

Immediate sensory input that doesn't require cognitive engagement:

• Cold water on face or wrists (instant sensation)
• Strong flavours like sour sweets
• Proprioceptive input (wall pushes, carrying something heavy)
• Passive sound (no attention required, just press play)

These tools bypass the struggling executive function system. They give the nervous system something to respond to without adding demands.

The ADHD brain needs immediate feedback. A strategy that takes 30 seconds to work might as well take 30 years.

Stop fighting how ADHD works. Start using tools designed for it.

Your exhausted self will thank you.

Rejection sensitive dysphoria.

If you have an ADHD child, you need to know this term.

RSD is an intense emotional response to real or perceived rejection, criticism, or failure. It's widely recognised among ADHD specialists, and it explains why your child might:

• Fall apart over gentle correction
• Avoid activities where they might not succeed
• Interpret neutral feedback as harsh criticism
• People-please intensely to avoid disapproval
• Seem "too sensitive" compared to peers

What you say: "That didn't quite work. Let's try again."

What they hear: "You're not good enough. You've failed."

The emotional pain they experience is genuine. Research shows it feels as intense as physical pain to them.

They're not being dramatic. They're not manipulating you. Their brain processes social feedback differently.

Knowing this doesn't fix it. But it changes everything about how you respond.

Instead of trying to reason them out of the feeling ("It wasn't that bad"), you help them through it:

• Reduce your words to the minimum
• Stay present without adding demands
• Validate the feeling without agreeing with the interpretation
• Wait for the storm to pass

Your ADHD child isn't broken. They just experience rejection and criticism at an intensity neurotypical people don't.

Once you understand that, patience becomes easier.

Have you noticed RSD patterns in your ADHD child? What helps in your household?
