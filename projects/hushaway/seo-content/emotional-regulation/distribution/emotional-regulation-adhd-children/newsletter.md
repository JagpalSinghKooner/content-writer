# Newsletter Snippet: Emotional Regulation for ADHD Children

## Hook

Your ADHD child melts down over the "wrong" breakfast cereal. You've tried deep breathing, calm-down jars, and counting to ten. Nothing works. Here's what nobody told you: emotional regulation for ADHD children isn't the same as for neurotypical kids.

## Body

Think of neurotypical emotional regulation like a dimmer switch. The feeling rises gradually, and there's time to turn it down before it gets too bright. ADHD emotional regulation is a light switch someone else controls. Feelings flip to full intensity instantly, and your child has no hand on the switch.

This isn't a discipline problem. It's neurology. The strategies that work for neurotypical children often make things worse for your ADHD child because they fight against how the ADHD brain actually processes feelings.

Standard advice assumes your child can notice they're becoming dysregulated, remember a coping strategy in the moment, execute it with focus, and wait for results. ADHD challenges every single one of these steps. During a meltdown, you're asking your child to use the exact brain functions that are offline.

So what works? Tools that don't require thinking, remembering, or focusing: immediate sensory input (cold water, strong flavours), passive sound that enters without demanding attention, movement before conversation, and fewer words with more presence.

## CTA

Your child's ADHD makes emotional regulation harder. That's the reality. But harder doesn't mean impossible. It just means the tools that work look different from what the standard parenting books suggest.
