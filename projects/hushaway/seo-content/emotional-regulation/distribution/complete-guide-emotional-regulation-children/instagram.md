# Instagram Content: Emotional Regulation for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
**EVERY REGULATION GUIDE**
**TELLS YOU WHAT TO TRY**

**NONE TELL YOU**
**WHAT TO PLAY**

[Bold text, high contrast - calming colour palette]

---

### Slide 2: The Problem
You've tried:
✓ Breathing exercises
✓ Fidget toys
✓ Calm corners
✓ Feelings charts
✓ Meditation apps

But when your child is overwhelmed...

None of it works.

---

### Slide 3: Why They Fail
Every tool assumes your child can:

→ Follow instructions
→ Make choices
→ Coordinate movements
→ Use their words

When they're dysregulated?

They can't do ANY of this.

---

### Slide 4: The Science
During high stress:

The thinking brain goes OFFLINE.

Skills they know during calm moments become temporarily inaccessible.

It's not defiance.
It's neurology.

---

### Slide 5: Sound Is Different
Sound works because it requires:

✗ No instructions
✗ No choices
✗ No coordination
✗ No language
✗ No effort

It just exists.
And the nervous system responds.

---

### Slide 6: The Research
Certain sound characteristics signal safety:

• Predictable rhythms
• Specific frequencies
• Gentle transitions

Sound bypasses the thinking brain entirely.

---

### Slide 7: For Neurodivergent Children
Their nervous systems work harder:

→ Processing sensory input
→ Managing attention
→ Responding to the world

Active strategies ADD load.

Passive sound ADDS NOTHING.

---

### Slide 8: When to Use Sound
✓ Calm corner foundation
✓ After-school reset
✓ Homework support
✓ Bedtime settling
✓ Meltdown recovery
✓ Morning transitions

Build familiarity in calm moments.
Then it works during crisis.

---

### Slide 9: Co-Regulation
Sound regulates BOTH of you at once.

You don't need to fake calm.
You don't need to go first.

The sound does the work.

You just have to be there.

---

### Slide 10: CTA
This is the tool that works precisely because it demands nothing.

## Caption

Every regulation guide gives you the same toolkit.

Breathing exercises. Fidget toys. Feelings charts. Calm corners.

You've tried them all. And when your child is overwhelmed? None of it works.

.
.
.

Here's the gap nobody talks about: every single tool requires your child to DO something. Follow instructions. Make choices. Use their words.

When they're genuinely dysregulated, their thinking brain has gone offline. The skills they know during calm moments become temporarily inaccessible.

This isn't defiance. It's neurology.

So what's left? Sound.

The only input that works without requiring anything in return. Research shows certain sound characteristics signal safety to the nervous system without requiring conscious processing. Predictable rhythms. Specific frequencies. Gentle transitions.

Sound bypasses the thinking brain entirely. It speaks directly to the survival brain that's running the show during dysregulation.

For neurodivergent children especially—whose nervous systems are already working harder—passive sound is often the only thing that helps during peak overwhelm.

This isn't about replacing other strategies. Breathing exercises work during calm moments. Visual supports help many children.

But in the moment when everything else fails? When your child is beyond the reach of instructions?

Sound is the tool that works precisely because it demands nothing.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Every regulation guide tells you what to try. None tell you what to play."

[Visual: Parent holding list of strategies, looking exhausted]

**[3-22 seconds: VALUE]**
"Here's the gap: every tool assumes your child can follow instructions. Make choices. Use their words.

But during a meltdown? Their thinking brain has gone offline.

Sound is different. It doesn't require participation. No instructions. No choices. No effort.

Research shows certain sounds signal safety to the nervous system without needing conscious processing.

For neurodivergent children especially—this zero-demand approach is often the ONLY thing that works."

[Visual: Calm child with headphones/speaker nearby, parent relaxed]

**[22-30 seconds: CTA]**
"This is the tool that works precisely because it demands nothing.

Follow for more calm strategies that actually work."
