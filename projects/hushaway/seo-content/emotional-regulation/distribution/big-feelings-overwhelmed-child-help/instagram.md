# Instagram Content: Big Feelings: What to Do in the First 60 Seconds

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
WHEN YOUR CHILD
HAS BIG FEELINGS

Every calming technique fails

(Here's what actually works)

### Slide 2: The Problem
Deep breathing?
They can't hear you.

Choices?
Makes it worse.

Hugs?
They push you away.

Nothing reaches them.

### Slide 3: Why Nothing Works
When your child is flooded,
their thinking brain goes offline.

Logic: Offline
Decisions: Offline
Instructions: Offline

The alarm system has taken over.

### Slide 4: What Advice Requires
"Take deep breaths"
→ Needs attention + motor planning

"Choose blue or red ball"
→ Needs decision-making

"Use your words"
→ Needs language processing

All unavailable right now.

### Slide 5: The First 60 Seconds
You need a tool that requires
NOTHING from your child.

No decisions
No actions
No instructions

Sound is that tool.

### Slide 6: Why Sound Works
Your child's ears still work.

Sound enters their
nervous system without
requiring conscious effort.

Press play. That's it.

Zero demands.

### Slide 7: What to Do
1. Have a sound ready
   (save it to your phone)

2. When big feelings start,
   press play

3. Don't combine with
   questions or instructions

4. Stay close, but don't
   expect engagement

5. Wait 60 seconds

### Slide 8: After the First Minute
Sound isn't the only tool.
It's the first tool.

After 60-90 seconds,
other strategies work again:

✓ Move closer
✓ Offer one choice
✓ Begin co-regulation
✓ Speak quietly

### Slide 9: The Reality
You're not doing this wrong.

Your child isn't choosing this.

Big feelings are overwhelming
because their nervous system
is still developing.

That's neurology.
Not your failure.

### Slide 10: CTA
Save this for the next storm 📌

## Caption

Your child is screaming and you've tried everything.

Deep breathing. Choices. Gentle words.

Nothing works.

.
.
.

Here's what you need to know: when your child is flooded with emotion, their thinking brain goes offline. The prefrontal cortex shuts down. The amygdala takes over.

Every calming technique requires brain functions that are temporarily unavailable right now.

You're not doing it wrong. Your child genuinely can't use these skills in that moment.

So what actually helps?

You need something that requires NOTHING from your child. No decisions. No actions. No instructions.

Sound.

When overwhelmed, your child's auditory processing still functions. Sound enters their nervous system without requiring conscious effort. You press play. That's it. Zero demands.

After 60 seconds, other strategies become possible again. But not before.

Set yourself up now while things are calm:
→ Save specific sounds to your phone
→ Create a shortcut (two taps or less)
→ Test they work without Wi-Fi

Because when big feelings hit, your own brain struggles too. Having the sound ready means one less decision for your overwhelmed brain to make.

The next storm will come. And when it does, you'll be ready.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your child is screaming and nothing you try works. Here's why."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"When your child has big feelings, their thinking brain goes offline. Logic: gone. Decisions: gone. Following instructions: gone.

Deep breathing? Needs attention they don't have.
Choices? Need decision-making that's offline.
Words? Need language processing that's unavailable.

You need something that requires NOTHING from them.

Sound.

Press play. Their ears still work. Sound enters without needing effort. Wait 60 seconds. Let the nervous system settle.

Then other strategies work again."
