# Twitter/X Content: Big Feelings: What to Do in the First 60 Seconds

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your child is screaming and nothing you try works.

Deep breathing? They can't hear you.
Choices? Makes it worse.
Hugs? They push you away.

Here's what actually helps when their thinking brain goes offline.

🧵 Thread:

1. WHY NOTHING WORKS

When your child is flooded with emotion, the prefrontal cortex (logic, decisions, instructions) shuts down.

The amygdala (alarm system) takes over.

You're asking them to use brain functions that are temporarily unavailable.

2. WHAT TYPICAL ADVICE REQUIRES

"Take deep breaths" → Needs understanding instructions + motor planning + attention

"Choose the blue or red ball" → Needs comparison + evaluation + decision-making

All offline during overwhelm.

### Tweet 4
3. THE FIRST 60 SECONDS

You need a tool that requires NOTHING from your child.

No decisions. No actions. No instructions.

Sound is that tool.

### Tweet 5
4. WHY SOUND WORKS

When overwhelmed, your child's auditory processing still functions.

Sound enters their nervous system without requiring conscious effort.

You press play. That's it.

No demands. Just support.

5. WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

→ Save a sound to your phone (before you need it)
→ When big feelings start, press play
→ Don't combine with questions or instructions
→ Stay close, don't expect engagement
→ Wait 60 seconds

### Tweet 7
6. AFTER THE FIRST MINUTE

Sound isn't the only tool. It's the first tool.

After 60-90 seconds, other strategies become possible:
→ Move closer
→ Offer ONE choice
→ Begin co-regulation
→ Speak quietly

But not before.

7. WHY STANDARD ADVICE FAILS

"Get down to their level" → Your face might add to overwhelm
"Offer choices" → Choices add demand
"Count to ten" → Requires sequencing ability
"Use feelings chart" → Requires decision-making

All good advice. Just not for the first 60 seconds.

8. THE REALITY

The fact that breathing exercises don't work when your child is flooded isn't a failure.

It's neurology.

The fact that choices make things worse isn't a failure.

It's neurology.

You're not doing this wrong.

9. SET UP NOW

The worst time to figure this out is during a meltdown.

While things are calm:
→ Save specific sounds
→ Create phone shortcut (2 taps max)
→ Test without Wi-Fi
→ Tell other caregivers where to find them

### Tweet 11
10. OLDER CHILDREN

The neurology doesn't change with age. A flooded nervous system is flooded whether they're 4 or 14.

Frame it as "I'm putting on background sound" (not something you're doing TO them).

Let them choose sounds during calm times.

### Tweet 12 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Big feelings = thinking brain offline
• Typical advice requires unavailable brain functions
• Sound works because it requires nothing
• Press play, wait 60 seconds
• Other strategies come after

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Your child isn't ignoring you during a meltdown.

Their prefrontal cortex (logic, instructions, decisions) has literally shut down.

The amygdala has taken over.

You're asking them to use brain functions that are temporarily unavailable.

That's not defiance. That's neurology.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

"Offer choices to calm them down" is terrible advice for the first 60 seconds of overwhelm.

Choices require cognitive processing.

During overwhelm, choices ADD demand.

You've accidentally made it worse.

### Tweet C (List)
5 things your child can't do when their thinking brain is offline:

• Follow breathing instructions
• Make choices between options
• Talk about their feelings
• Use a fidget or toy
• Process your reassuring words

Stop trying. Start with sound instead.

### Tweet D (Question)
Why does every calming technique fail when your child has big feelings?

Because the prefrontal cortex shuts down during overwhelm.

You're asking for logic, choices, and instructions when those brain functions are offline.

### Tweet E (Proof)
I stopped trying deep breathing and choices during my child's meltdowns.

Started with sound instead (requires nothing from them).

60 seconds of sound → then other strategies.

Game changer.

Not because sound is magic. Because it matches their neurological reality.
