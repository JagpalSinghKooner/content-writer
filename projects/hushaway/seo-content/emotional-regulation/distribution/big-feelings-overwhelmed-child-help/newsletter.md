# Newsletter Snippet: Big Feelings: What to Do in the First 60 Seconds

## Hook

Your child is screaming. Face red. Body rigid. You've tried deep breathing, choices, gentle words. Nothing works. Not because you're doing it wrong—but because in that moment, your child's thinking brain has gone offline. And every calming technique requires a brain function that's temporarily unavailable.

## Body

When children are flooded with emotion, the prefrontal cortex (logic, decisions, instructions) shuts down. The amygdala takes over. This is why standard advice fails during genuine overwhelm. Deep breathing requires understanding instructions. Choices require decision-making. Talking about feelings requires language processing. All offline.

You need something that requires nothing from your child. No decisions. No actions. No instructions. Sound is that tool. When overwhelmed, their auditory processing still functions. Sound enters their nervous system without requiring conscious effort. You press play. That's it. The sound meets them exactly where they are, with zero demands.

After 60 seconds, other strategies become possible again. But not before. Think of it like this: when someone is drowning, you throw them a life ring first. Sound is the life ring. Everything else comes after.

## CTA

The next storm will come. Set yourself up now while things are calm.
