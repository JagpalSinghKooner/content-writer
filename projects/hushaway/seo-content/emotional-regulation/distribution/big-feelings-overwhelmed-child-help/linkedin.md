# LinkedIn Content: Big Feelings: What to Do in the First 60 Seconds

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
When your child has big feelings,
every calming technique fails.

Deep breathing? They can't hear you.
Choices? Makes it worse.
Hugs? They push you away.

Swipe → to learn what actually works
when they can't do anything at all

### Slide 2: Why Nothing Works
When your child is flooded with emotion,
their thinking brain goes offline.

The prefrontal cortex (logic, decisions,
following instructions) shuts down.

The amygdala (alarm system) takes over.

You're not doing it wrong.
Your child can't use the skills you're asking for.

### Slide 3: What Typical Advice Requires
Deep breathing:
→ Understanding instructions
→ Motor planning
→ Sustained attention

Making choices:
→ Comparison
→ Evaluation
→ Decision-making

All of these brain functions are offline.

### Slide 4: The First 60 Seconds
You need a tool that requires
NOTHING from your child.

No decisions.
No actions.
No instructions.
No participation.

Sound is that tool.

### Slide 5: Why Sound Works
When your child is overwhelmed,
their auditory processing still functions.

Sound enters their nervous system
without requiring conscious effort.

You press play.
That's it.

No demands.
No choices.
Just support.

### Slide 6: What to Do Right Now
1. Have a sound ready (save it to your phone)

2. When big feelings start, press play

3. Don't combine with questions or instructions

4. Stay close, but don't expect engagement

5. Wait 60 seconds while the nervous system settles

### Slide 7: After the First Minute
Sound isn't the only tool.
It's the first tool.

After 60-90 seconds, other strategies
become possible again:

→ Move closer if receptive
→ Offer a single choice (not multiple)
→ Begin gentle co-regulation
→ Speak quietly, fewer words

But don't rush this transition.

### Slide 8: Summary
Quick recap:

1. Big feelings = thinking brain offline
2. Typical advice can't work yet
3. Sound requires nothing from your child
4. Press play, wait 60 seconds
5. Other strategies come after

And you'll be ready.

Your child is screaming. Face red. Body rigid.

You've tried everything. Getting down to their level. Speaking softly. Offering choices. Deep breathing together.

Good advice. All of it.

And none of it works right now.

Here's why:

When your child is flooded with emotion, their thinking brain goes offline. The prefrontal cortex shuts down. The amygdala takes over.

Every calming technique requires brain functions that are temporarily unavailable:

Deep breathing → Requires understanding instructions, motor planning, attention (all offline)

Choices → Require comparison, evaluation, decision-making (all offline)

Talking about feelings → Requires language processing, vocabulary retrieval (all offline)

You're not doing it wrong. Your child genuinely can't use these skills in that moment.

So what actually helps?

You need something that requires NOTHING from your child. No decisions. No actions. No instructions. No participation.

Sound.

When your child is overwhelmed, their auditory processing still functions. Sound enters their nervous system without requiring conscious effort.

You press play. That's it.

The sound fills the space. Meets their nervous system exactly where it is. No demands whatsoever.

After 60 seconds, other strategies become possible again. But not before.

Think of it like this: when someone is drowning, you don't start by teaching them to swim. You throw them a life ring first.

Sound is the life ring.

Everything else comes after.

Set yourself up now, while things are calm:
→ Save specific sounds to your phone
→ Create a shortcut (two taps or less)
→ Test they work without Wi-Fi

Because when big feelings hit, your own brain struggles too. Having the sound ready means one less decision for your overwhelmed brain to make.

The next storm will come. And when it does, you'll be ready.

"Get down to their level."
"Offer choices to give them control."
"Try counting to ten together."

Standard parenting advice for big feelings.

All of it fails during genuine overwhelm.

Here's what the advice misses:

**"Get down to their level"** → Good for connection. But during peak overwhelm, your child may not process visual information effectively. Your face, especially if you look worried, might add to their overwhelm.

**"Offer choices"** → Choices require cognitive processing. During overwhelm, choices add demand. Demand increases overwhelm. You've accidentally made it worse.

**"Try counting together"** → Counting requires sequencing, number recall, sustained attention. None of which are available right now.

**"Use a feelings chart"** → Visual processing, vocabulary matching, decision-making. All offline.

None of this advice is wrong.

It's just wrong for the first sixty seconds when your child can't do anything at all.

What helps in that moment is the absence of demand.

Sound provides that absence while still offering something supportive.

You're not imagining that nothing works. It genuinely can't work when your child's brain is in alarm mode.

And knowing this, you can stop trying the things that can't work in those moments, and start trying the one thing that can.

Press play. Wait. Stay close. Let the sound do what words can't.

The storm will pass. And you'll both be there when it does.

What's helped your child during overwhelm? I'm curious what other parents have discovered.

## Text Post 3

If you've read this far, you're probably exhausted.

You've tried everything. You've blamed yourself more than once.

Here's what you need to hear:

Your child isn't choosing this.

And you're not causing it by doing something wrong.

Big feelings are overwhelming for children because their nervous systems are still developing. Some children's nervous systems are more sensitive than others. Some are wired differently.

None of this is about good parenting or bad parenting.

The fact that breathing exercises don't work when your child is flooded?
→ That's not a failure. It's neurology.

The fact that choices make things worse?
→ That's not a failure. It's neurology.

The fact that nothing reaches them in those first terrible seconds?
→ That's not a failure. It's neurology.

When a child is overwhelmed, something specific happens in their brain. The prefrontal cortex (responsible for rational thought, decision-making, following instructions) essentially shuts down. The amygdala takes complete control.

During high stress, children lose access to the very skills we ask them to use.

This is why everything you're trying isn't working. Not because you're doing it wrong. Not because your child is being difficult. But because you're asking them to use brain functions that are temporarily unavailable.

And knowing this, you can stop trying the things that can't work in those moments.

You need a tool that requires nothing from your child when their thinking brain is offline.

Sound is that tool.

Press play. Wait. Stay close.

The storm will pass. And you'll both be there when it does.

You're doing better than you think.
