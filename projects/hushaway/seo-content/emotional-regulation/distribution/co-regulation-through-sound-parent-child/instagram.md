# Instagram Content: Co-Regulation Through Sound

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
**"JUST STAY CALM"**

**But HOW?**

(The co-regulation tool that works on both of you at once)

### Slide 2: The Problem
When your child melts down, your nervous system fires alongside theirs.

Your heart pounds.
Your shoulders tense.
Your body screams something's wrong.

This isn't a flaw. It's biology.

### Slide 3: The Impossible Ask
Every co-regulation guide:

✗ Take deep breaths
✗ Ground yourself
✗ Use a calming voice
✗ Step away

All require YOU to regulate FIRST.

Through willpower. While your child is in crisis.

### Slide 4: The Feedback Loop
When you're struggling to regulate, your child senses it.

They feel your tension.
Their nervous system reads: "not safe."
They become MORE overwhelmed.

You feel the increase.
You become MORE stressed.

The cycle locks you both in.

### Slide 5: What Actually Works
Sound affects the nervous system directly.

No thinking.
No doing.
No conscious effort.

It works on BOTH of you.
At the same time.

### Slide 6: Passive Co-Regulation
Press play.

The sound fills the space.
Enters your nervous system.
Enters your child's nervous system.

Neither of you has to do anything.
Neither of you has to go first.

### Slide 7: What Happens
For both of you:

• Breathing naturally slows
• Heart rate decreases
• Muscle tension releases

The stress feedback loop becomes a settling feedback loop.

### Slide 8: You Matter Too
Most guides treat your regulation as a tool for your child.

Passive sound is different.

It helps you because YOU deserve to feel calmer.

Not just as a means to help them.

Because you're a person too.

### Slide 9: No Willpower Needed
You don't need energy to press play.

You don't need to be calm first.
Or regulated first.
Or anything first.

Just introduce sound and let biology do what willpower couldn't.

### Slide 10: CTA
Save this for the next hard moment 📌

## Caption

"Just stay calm."

You've heard it a hundred times. From books. From therapists. From that person at the supermarket who's never wrestled a screaming child into a car seat.

And you want to scream back: WITH WHAT ENERGY?

.
.
.

Here's what nobody acknowledges. When your child is mid-meltdown, your nervous system isn't calmly waiting for instructions. It's firing right alongside theirs.

This isn't a character flaw. It's biology. When your child's nervous system goes into fight-or-flight, yours receives that message and starts preparing for threat too.

Traditional co-regulation strategies all share the same flaw. They require YOU to regulate first. Alone. While your child is still in crisis. Every strategy puts the entire burden on you.

And if you're struggling to regulate, your child picks up on that. They sense your tension. Their nervous system reads yours and gets the message that things aren't safe. Which makes them MORE overwhelmed.

It becomes a feedback loop. Neither of you can break it alone.

.
.
.

What if you didn't have to regulate alone?

Sound affects the nervous system directly. It doesn't require thinking, choosing, or doing. It enters through the ears and influences autonomic function without conscious effort.

And here's what makes sound unique. It works on BOTH of you at the same time.

When you press play, the sound fills the space. It enters your nervous system. It enters your child's nervous system. Neither of you has to do anything. Neither of you has to go first.

For both of you: breathing naturally slows, heart rate decreases, muscle tension releases. The feedback loop of stress becomes a feedback loop of settling.

Most resources focus entirely on helping your child. But you deserve to feel calmer too. Not just because it makes you a better tool. Because you're a person too.

When you press play, you're meeting both needs at once.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Every parenting book: 'Just stay calm.'
Me, mid-meltdown: 'WITH WHAT ENERGY?'"

**[3-22 seconds: VALUE]**
"Here's what nobody tells you.

When your child's nervous system goes into fight-or-flight, yours does too. This is biology.

Traditional co-regulation? Requires YOU to regulate first. Through willpower. While your child is in crisis.

But sound works on BOTH nervous systems at once.

Press play. Neither of you has to do anything. Neither of you has to go first.

The feedback loop of stress becomes a feedback loop of settling."

**[22-30 seconds: CTA]**
"You don't have to regulate alone.

Follow for more tools that actually work when you're both overwhelmed."
