# LinkedIn Content: Emotional Regulation in Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
Your child can't calm down.

Not because they won't listen.

Because their brain literally can't process your instructions right now.

Swipe → to understand what's really happening

### Slide 2: What Is Emotional Regulation?
It's not about never getting upset.

It's not about suppressing feelings.

It's about your nervous system's ability to recover from stress and return to calm.

For some children, this is significantly harder.

### Slide 3: The Brain Science
During intense emotions:

The prefrontal cortex (thinking brain) goes offline.

The amygdala (alarm system) takes over.

Your child literally cannot access coping strategies in that moment.

### Slide 4: The Neurodivergent Difference
For ADHD children:
Feelings arrive faster, bigger, harder to shift.

For autistic children:
Sensory input others barely notice can be genuinely distressing.

Their nervous system isn't broken. It's wired differently.

### Slide 5: Why Standard Advice Fails
Breathing exercises require following multi-step instructions.

Fidget toys require decision-making.

Calm corners with choices require prefrontal cortex function.

All of these are offline during peak dysregulation.

### Slide 6: What Actually Helps
Passive support.

No instructions. No choices. No demands.

Just a calming presence their nervous system can settle into.

Sound works because it requires nothing from your child.

### Slide 7: Building Capacity Over Time
Reduce baseline stress through predictable routines.

Co-regulate first (your calm helps theirs).

Repair after rupture (recovery builds neural pathways).

Meet them where they are, not where neurotypical strategies expect them to be.

### Slide 8: The Reframe
This isn't a behaviour problem.

It's neurology.

Your child isn't giving you a hard time.

They're having a hard time.

### Slide 9: Summary
Quick recap:

1. Emotional regulation is a capacity, not just a skill
2. The thinking brain goes offline during distress
3. Standard advice requires abilities they don't have in that moment
4. Passive support works when active strategies can't
5. Understanding this changes everything

Your child is screaming. You're trying to stay calm. You've asked them to take deep breaths. Nothing works.

Here's what nobody tells you:

When your child is in the middle of big feelings, they're not choosing to ignore your advice. Their brain is temporarily unable to process it.

This isn't a behaviour problem. It's neurology.

During intense emotions, the prefrontal cortex (the thinking part) goes offline whilst the amygdala (the alarm system) takes control. Research confirms this. Your child literally cannot think their way out of distress in that moment.

This is why "just calm down" doesn't work. It's not that they won't. They can't.

For neurodivergent children, this process is often more intense and more frequent. ADHD brings heightened emotional intensity. Autism brings sensory overwhelm that looks like overreacting but is genuinely distressing. And for many, their nervous system is already running at full capacity before the day even starts.

So what actually helps?

Passive support. Tools that require nothing from your child. No instructions. No choices. No demands.

Just a calming presence their nervous system can settle into.

Sound is one of the most effective forms of passive support. It enters the environment without demanding anything. Your child doesn't need to choose it, engage with it, or even acknowledge it.

Their nervous system can respond to predictable audio even when their conscious brain is overwhelmed.

Understanding emotional regulation as neurological rather than behavioural changes everything. You stop blaming yourself for not having the magic words. You stop blaming your child for not "just calming down."

And you start looking for tools that work with their nervous system, not against it.

## Text Post 2

After 7 years running a nursery and decades supporting neurodivergent children, here's the most important thing I've learnt about emotional regulation:

Standard advice is designed for neurotypical children in calm moments.

Breathing exercises? Require multi-step instructions during peak distress.
Fidget toys? Need decision-making when that ability is offline.
Calm corners with options? Demand choices from an overwhelmed brain.

None of these strategies are bad. They're just the wrong tool for the wrong moment.

Here's what most resources won't tell you: when your child is flooded with emotion, active strategies won't work. Not because your child isn't trying. But because the part of their brain that processes instructions has temporarily shut down.

This is especially true for sensitive and neurodivergent children.

The solution isn't more strategies. It's different strategies.

Passive support works when active tools can't. This means environmental changes that require nothing from your child:
• A predictable sound playing in the background
• Your calm presence without demands
• Reduced sensory input
• Time and space to recover

We created The Open Sanctuary because we needed this ourselves. Sounds designed for neurodivergent children. No interaction required. Just press play.

Your child's nervous system can respond to calming audio even when their conscious mind is overwhelmed. That's the power of passive support.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Sometimes it can change yours too.

Every time your child has big feelings and recovers safely with you, they're building neural pathways.

They're learning that distress is survivable. That calm comes back. That you're there.

This is called co-regulation, and it's the foundation of self-regulation.

Your child doesn't need you to fix the feeling. They need you to stay steady whilst they experience it.

But here's the part nobody warns you about: co-regulation is exhausting when you're already running on empty. When you've had broken sleep, a difficult school run, and another email from the teacher saying your child "had a challenging day."

You can't pour from an empty cup. And yet that's what we're expected to do.

This is why we focus on tools that require minimal effort from exhausted parents. Sounds you press play on and walk away from. Routines that run themselves. Strategies that work in the background whilst you catch your breath.

You don't need more shoulds. You need solutions that actually fit into real life.

Because when you're less exhausted, co-regulation becomes possible again. Your nervous system can help regulate theirs. The cycle starts to shift.

If you're struggling right now, you're not alone. This is hard work. And you're doing it.

Explore The Open Sanctuary when you're ready. It's free, it requires nothing from you except pressing play, and it might just give you both the breathing room you need.
