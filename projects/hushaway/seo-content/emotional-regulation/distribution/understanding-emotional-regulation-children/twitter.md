# Twitter/X Content: Emotional Regulation in Children

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your child can't calm down because their brain literally can't process your instructions right now.

Not won't. Can't.

Here's what's really happening (and what actually helps):

🧵

### Tweet 2
Emotional regulation isn't about never getting upset.

It's your nervous system's ability to manage feelings and return to calm after stress.

For some children (especially neurodivergent), this is significantly harder.

### Tweet 3
During intense emotions:

• Prefrontal cortex (thinking brain) → offline
• Amygdala (alarm system) → in control

Your child literally cannot access coping strategies in that moment.

This isn't behaviour. It's brain science.

### Tweet 4
Standard advice assumes your child can:
• Follow multi-step instructions (breathing exercises)
• Make decisions (choose a fidget toy)
• Process language (talk about feelings)

All of these require the prefrontal cortex.

Which is offline.

### Tweet 5
For ADHD children:
Feelings arrive faster, bigger, harder to shift.

For autistic children:
Sensory input others barely notice can be genuinely overwhelming.

Their nervous system isn't broken. It's wired differently.

### Tweet 6
So what actually helps during peak dysregulation?

Passive support.

No instructions. No choices. No demands.

Just environmental changes their nervous system can respond to without requiring conscious participation.

### Tweet 7
Why sound works:

It enters the environment without demanding anything.

Your child doesn't need to:
• Choose it
• Engage with it
• Acknowledge it

Their nervous system can respond even when their conscious brain is overwhelmed.

### Tweet 8
Building regulation capacity over time:

1. Reduce baseline stress (predictable routines)
2. Co-regulate first (your calm helps theirs)
3. Repair after rupture (recovery builds neural pathways)
4. Meet them where they are

The goal isn't preventing all dysregulation. It's helping them recover.

### Tweet 9
The reframe that changes everything:

This isn't a behaviour problem. It's neurology.

Your child isn't giving you a hard time.

They're having a hard time.

### Tweet 10 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Thinking brain goes offline during big feelings
• Standard advice requires abilities they don't have then
• Passive support works when active strategies can't
• Understanding this changes your whole approach

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Insight)
Unpopular opinion:

Most emotional regulation advice is designed for neurotypical children in calm moments.

For neurodivergent children during peak distress? It's the wrong tool entirely.

Passive support > active strategies when the thinking brain is offline.

### Tweet B (Hot Take)
Stop telling overwhelmed children to "just breathe."

Their prefrontal cortex (the part that processes instructions) is literally offline during intense emotions.

They can't follow breathing exercises because the brain function required for that isn't available.

### Tweet C (List)
5 things nobody tells you about emotional dysregulation in children:

1. It's neurological, not behavioural
2. Standard advice requires brain functions that are offline
3. ND children experience this more intensely
4. Passive support works when active tools don't
5. Co-regulation comes before self-regulation

### Tweet D (Question)
Why do so many children melt down the moment they get home from school?

It's called delayed dysregulation.

They held it together all day. Used every bit of regulatory capacity in the classroom.

By the time they're home? Nothing left.

The slightest thing triggers the release.

### Tweet E (Proof)
After 7 years running a nursery and decades supporting neurodivergent children, here's what I know:

The children who "can't regulate" aren't lacking skills.

They're lacking the neurological capacity to access those skills under stress.

Different problem = different solution.
