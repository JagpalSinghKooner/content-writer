# Instagram Content: Emotional Regulation in Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
YOUR CHILD CAN'T CALM DOWN

Not because they won't listen

Because their brain literally can't right now

[Large, bold text on calm background - high contrast]

### Slide 2: The Truth
When your child is flooded with emotion...

The thinking part of their brain goes OFFLINE

This isn't behaviour

It's brain science

### Slide 3: What's Happening
Prefrontal cortex
(thinking brain)
→ OFFLINE

Amygdala
(alarm system)
→ IN CONTROL

They can't process instructions in this state

### Slide 4: Standard Advice Fails
Breathing exercises?
Require following instructions

Fidget toys?
Need decision-making

Feelings charts?
Demand language processing

All require brain functions that are OFFLINE

### Slide 5: The ND Difference
ADHD children:
Feelings arrive faster, bigger, harder to shift

Autistic children:
Sensory overwhelm that's genuinely distressing

Their nervous system isn't broken
It's wired differently

### Slide 6: What Actually Helps
PASSIVE SUPPORT

✓ No instructions
✓ No choices
✓ No demands

Just a calming presence their nervous system can settle into

### Slide 7: Why Sound Works
Sound enters the environment without demanding anything

Your child doesn't need to:
• Choose it
• Engage with it
• Acknowledge it

Their nervous system responds anyway

### Slide 8: Building Capacity
1. Reduce baseline stress
2. Co-regulate first
3. Repair after rupture
4. Meet them where they are

The goal isn't preventing all big feelings

It's helping them recover

### Slide 9: The Reframe
This isn't a behaviour problem

It's neurology

Your child isn't giving you a hard time

They're HAVING a hard time

### Slide 10: CTA

## Caption

Your child can't calm down. Not because they won't listen. Because their brain literally can't process your instructions right now.

Here's what nobody tells you about emotional regulation: when your child is in the middle of big feelings, the thinking part of their brain (prefrontal cortex) goes offline. The alarm system (amygdala) takes control.

This isn't a behaviour problem. It's neurology.

During this state, your child cannot follow breathing exercises, choose fidget toys, or talk about their feelings. All of those require brain functions that are temporarily unavailable.

For neurodivergent children, this happens more intensely and more frequently. ADHD brings heightened emotional intensity. Autism brings sensory overwhelm. Their nervous system is already working harder, and when it's pushed past capacity, standard advice doesn't work.

So what actually helps?

Passive support. Tools that require nothing from your child. No instructions. No choices. No demands. Just environmental changes their nervous system can respond to.

Sound is one of the most effective forms of passive support. It enters the environment without demanding anything. Your child doesn't need to engage with it. Their nervous system can respond even when their conscious brain is overwhelmed.

Understanding this changes everything. You stop blaming yourself for not having magic words. You stop blaming your child for not "just calming down." And you start looking for tools that work WITH their nervous system, not against it.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Sometimes it can change yours too.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your child can't calm down. Here's the real reason why..."

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
"During big feelings, the thinking part of their brain goes OFFLINE. The alarm system takes over.

They literally can't process your instructions.

Breathing exercises? Need instruction-following.
Fidget toys? Need decision-making.
Feelings charts? Need language processing.

All require brain functions that aren't available.

For neurodivergent children, this is more intense and more frequent."

**[20-30 seconds: CTA]**
"What actually helps? Passive support. Tools that require nothing from your child.

Follow for more parent-to-parent support that actually works."
