# Newsletter Snippet: Emotional Regulation in Children

## Hook

Your child is screaming. You've tried the breathing exercises, offered their favourite toy, spoken in your calmest voice. Nothing works. You've wondered, more than once, if you're somehow failing them.

## Body

Here's what nobody tells you: when your child is in the middle of big feelings, they're not choosing to ignore your advice. Their brain is temporarily unable to process it.

During intense emotions, the prefrontal cortex (the thinking part of the brain) goes offline whilst the amygdala (the alarm system) takes control. This isn't a behaviour problem. It's neurology. Your child literally cannot think their way out of distress in that moment.

For neurodivergent children, this process is often more intense and more frequent. ADHD brings heightened emotional intensity. Autism brings sensory overwhelm that looks like overreacting but is genuinely distressing. Their nervous system is already working harder than most, and when it's pushed past capacity, standard advice simply doesn't work.

The solution isn't more breathing exercises or feelings charts. It's passive support. Tools that require nothing from your child when they have nothing to give. Environmental changes like calming sounds that work in the background, your steady presence without demands, reduced sensory input.

Understanding emotional regulation as neurological rather than behavioural changes everything. You stop blaming yourself for not having the magic words. You stop blaming your child for not "just calming down." And you start looking for tools that work with their nervous system, not against it.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. Sometimes it can change yours too.
