# Instagram Content: Calm Corner Sounds for Children

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
THE MISSING PIECE
IN EVERY CALM CORNER

(Spoiler: it's not another fidget toy)

### Slide 2: You Did Everything Right
The cushions ✓
The fidget toys ✓
The weighted blanket ✓

So why won't they use it during meltdown?

### Slide 3: The Problem
Every guide tells you what OBJECTS to include.

None tell you what SOUNDS to play.

That's the missing piece.

### Slide 4: Why Sound?
When your child is overwhelmed, sound is the ONLY tool that works passively.

No choices.
No instructions.
No effort required.

Just sound, meeting their nervous system where it is.

### Slide 5: The Science Bit
Research shows: specific acoustic patterns influence emotional processing at a neurological level.

The brainstem responds to sound BEFORE the conscious mind registers it.

### Slide 6: Red Zone (Meltdown)
What works:
→ Low-frequency sounds
→ ASMR audio
→ Slow rhythmic patterns
→ Ambient sounds

What doesn't:
→ Music with lyrics
→ Upbeat tempos
→ Sudden changes

### Slide 7: Yellow Zone (Escalating)
What works:
→ Predictable patterns
→ Layered sounds
→ Soft ambient audio

What doesn't:
→ Silence (leaves room for internal chaos)
→ Busy music (adds stimulation)

### Slide 8: Blue Zone (Withdrawn)
What works:
→ Warm, gentle tones
→ Soft affirmations
→ Comforting nature sounds

What doesn't:
→ Upbeat music (too jarring)
→ Complete silence (feels isolating)

### Slide 9: Green Zone (Calm)
What works:
→ Binaural beats for focus
→ Subtle background audio
→ Pleasant ambient sounds

What doesn't:
→ Complete silence during tasks
→ Loud or variable sounds

### Slide 10: Start Tonight
Equipment needed: Just a phone or tablet with a speaker.

Pro tip: Start playing the sound BEFORE your child enters the calm corner.

Let the sound fill the space first.

### Slide 11: CTA
Save this for the next meltdown 📌

## Caption

Every calm corner guide tells you what objects to include.

None tell you what sounds to play.

Here's what we've learned: sound is the missing piece that makes everything else work.

When your child is overwhelmed, sound might be the only thing that reaches them without requiring anything in return. No choices to make. No objects to pick up. No instructions to follow.

Research shows specific acoustic patterns can influence emotional processing at a neurological level. The brainstem responds to sound before the conscious mind even registers it.

For children in the Red Zone, this matters enormously. Their conscious brain is overwhelmed. But their brainstem is still listening.

Not all sounds work for all moments. The sound that helps your child maintain focus during homework won't be the same sound that helps them recover from a meltdown.

Swipe through to learn what sounds work for Red Zone (meltdown), Yellow Zone (escalating), Blue Zone (withdrawn), and Green Zone (maintaining calm).

Equipment needed? At minimum, just a phone or tablet with a speaker. Better: a dedicated small speaker that stays in the calm corner.

One tip that makes a difference: start playing the sound BEFORE your child enters the calm corner. Let the sound fill the space first. They arrive into an already-calming environment.

Your calm corner isn't complete without sound. It's not a nice extra. It's what makes everything else work better.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"You built the perfect calm corner. So why won't they use it during an actual meltdown?"

**[3-22 seconds: VALUE]**
"Here's what every guide forgets: SOUND.

When your child is overwhelmed, sound is the only tool that works passively. No choices. No instructions. No effort.

Research shows the brainstem responds to sound BEFORE the conscious mind registers it.

Red Zone meltdown? Low-frequency sounds and ASMR.
Yellow Zone escalating? Predictable patterns.
Green Zone maintaining calm? Binaural beats.

Not all sounds work for all moments. Match sound to emotional state."

**[22-30 seconds: CTA]**
"Your calm corner is incomplete without sound. Start tonight with just your phone and a speaker.
