## Link Audit Summary

### Internal Link Format Violations

**Rule:** Internal links must use `/{slug}` format. No directory structures, no file paths, no number prefixes.

Every article in this pillar uses the incorrect format. Links use `/pillar/articles/nn-slug` instead of `/{slug}`.

**Total violations: 71 across all 7 articles.**

### Broken Internal Links (Slug Mismatch)

| Article | Link Used | Actual Slug | Issue |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 01 (line 207) | `/emotional-regulation/articles/02-guide-emotional-regulation-autistic-children` | `guide-emotional-regulation-autistic-children` | File is `02-emotional-regulation-autistic-children.md` but link says `02-guide-emotional-regulation-autistic-children` |
| 03 (line 245) | `/emotional-regulation/articles/02-guide-emotional-regulation-autistic-children` | `guide-emotional-regulation-autistic-children` | Same mismatch as article 01 |

**Note:** Article 02's frontmatter slug is `guide-emotional-regulation-autistic-children` but the filename is `02-emotional-regulation-autistic-children.md`. The internal links from articles 01 and 03 reference a path that doesn't match either the slug or the filename.

### Cross-Pillar Links

| Direction | Count | Target Pillars |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Outbound | 12 | adhd-sleep (5), autistic-meltdowns (4), sensory-overload (3), calming-sounds (5) |
| Inbound | Not checked (would require reading other pillars) |

### Pillar Guide Coverage

| Check | Value | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Guide → Supporting (body links) | 6/6 | PASS |
| Supporting → Guide (body links) | 6/6 | PASS |

All supporting articles link to the pillar guide. The pillar guide links to all supporting articles.

## Cross-Article Consistency

### Terminology Variations

| Term Cluster | Variations | Articles | Action |
|--------------|------------|----------|--------|
| dysregulation/overwhelm | "emotional dysregulation" + "overwhelm" used interchangeably | All | WARN - Profile says avoid "dysregulation" (clinical), use "overwhelm" or "big feelings". Articles use both. Consider standardising to "overwhelm" in parent-facing text, keeping "dysregulation" only in FAQ/SEO keyword contexts. |
| intervention/support | "intervention" used in article 07 line 510 | 07 | WARN - Profile lists "intervention" as a word to avoid. Replace with "support" or "help". |

### Conflicting Claims

No conflicting factual claims found across articles. Statistics and research references are consistent.

### Positioning Alignment

| Article | Assigned Angle | Alignment |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| 01 | It's neurology, not behaviour | Strong |
| 02 | Generic strategies fail autistic children | Strong |
| 03 | Tools must work WITH the ADHD brain | Strong |
| 04 | Calm corners are missing sound (conversion driver) | Strong |
| 05 | Sound regulates both parent and child | Strong |
| 06 | Sound first in the first 60 seconds | Strong |
| 07 | Sound is the missing tool in regulation | Strong |

All articles align well with their assigned positioning angles from `02-positioning.md`.

## Summary of Issues Requiring Manual Review

### Must Fix (FAIL)

1. **Internal link format (71 instances across all 7 articles):** All internal links must be converted from `/pillar/articles/nn-slug` to `/{slug}` format. This is an auto-fixable issue.

2. **Broken internal link slug mismatch (2 instances in articles 01, 03):** Links reference `02-guide-emotional-regulation-autistic-children` but the file is `02-emotional-regulation-autistic-children.md`. Need to verify correct slug and fix.

### Cannot Auto-Fix (Escalate)

3. **Broken citation URL: zonesofregulation.com (articles 04, 07):** Page returns 404. Find replacement URL or remove citation.

4. **Broken citation URL: nhs.uk/emotions (articles 06, 07):** NHS page returns 404. Find replacement URL.

5. **Broken citation URL: hushaway.com/the-open-sanctuary (article 05):** Returns 404. Verify correct URL when site is live.

### Should Fix (WARN)

6. **Clinical term "intervention" (article 07, line 510):** Replace with "support" per brand voice rules.

7. **Clinical term "dysregulation" used extensively:** Consider reducing in parent-facing body text, keeping only in FAQ/SEO contexts.
