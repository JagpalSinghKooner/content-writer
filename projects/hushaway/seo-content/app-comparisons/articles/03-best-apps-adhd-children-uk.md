It's 10:47pm. You're exhausted. Your ADHD child is wired, restless, nowhere near sleep.

You've tried the "best" calming apps. The ones with thousands of five-star reviews. The ones other parents swear by.

They don't work for your child.

Here's the thing most app makers won't tell you: ADHD apps for kids weren't designed for ADHD brains at all. They were built for neurotypical children, then marketed to ADHD families as an afterthought. They require exactly what ADHD children struggle with most: sustained attention, following instructions, and delayed gratification.

If your child can't calm down enough to use a calming app, the problem isn't your child. The problem is the app.

This guide reviews the best apps for ADHD children in the UK through an ADHD-specific lens. Not which apps claim to help. Which ones actually work WITH the racing brain instead of fighting it.

## What ADHD Children Actually Need From a Calming App

Before reviewing specific apps, we need to understand what makes an app ADHD-friendly. The ADHD brain works differently, and those differences matter enormously when choosing calming tools.

### The Racing Brain Problem

ADHD children don't struggle with calm because they don't want it. They struggle because their brains don't have an off switch.

According to NICE guidance on ADHD management, sleep problems affect 25-50% of children with ADHD (NICE, 2024: [Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: diagnosis and management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng87)). That's half of all ADHD children struggling with sleep. Not because they're difficult. Because their brains work differently.

At bedtime, the neurotypical brain starts winding down naturally. The ADHD brain often does the opposite, becoming more active as the body tires. Research published in the Journal of Attention Disorders found that adolescents with ADHD showed much higher rates of sleep onset difficulties, with racing thoughts being the primary cause (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2019: [Sleep disturbances in adolescents with ADHD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6534423/)).

This means any calming app that requires your child to "focus on your breath" or "imagine a peaceful place" has already failed. The ADHD brain can't hold that focus during peak dysregulation.

### What Actually Works for ADHD Brains

The best ADHD apps for kids share specific characteristics:

**Immediate engagement without demands.** The ADHD brain needs something to land on immediately. Not "wait for the meditation to start" or "select your mood." Something that captures attention the moment you press play. Zero decisions required.

**Passive listening, not active participation.** Following instructions requires executive function, which is exactly what's offline when your ADHD child is overwhelmed. The app needs to work without any cognitive effort from your child.

**Novelty without overwhelm.** ADHD brains crave novelty, but too much stimulation makes things worse. The best ADHD focus app for children threads this needle: interesting enough to hold attention, calm enough to soothe. Think gentle variety, not chaotic change.

**No delayed gratification.** "This will help after 10 sessions" doesn't work for ADHD children. They need to feel something tonight. Not next week.

## The Best ADHD Calming Apps UK 2026: Honest Reviews

I've tested these apps specifically through an ADHD lens. Not "is this a nice app?" but "does this work when my ADHD child's brain won't switch off?"

### Moshi Kids

**What it is:** UK-based audio app with stories, meditations, and sounds. Over 400 pieces of content, celebrity narrators including Patrick Stewart and Brian Blessed.

**ADHD suitability: Mixed**

Moshi's strength is passive listening. Your child doesn't need to follow instructions or make choices once a story starts. The narration is engaging, and the heart-rate-synced soundtracks help with sleep onset.

But Moshi wasn't designed for ADHD children specifically. Some content requires attention spans that ADHD children don't have. The story selection process itself can become overwhelming when executive function is low.

**Works WITH the ADHD brain:**
- Passive listening once started
- Engaging narrators hold attention
- Sleep stories can help with racing thoughts
- No interaction required during playback

**Fights the ADHD brain:**
- Content selection requires decisions during dysregulation
- Some stories are too long for ADHD attention spans
- No frequency-based sounds (binaural beats, solfeggio)
- Becomes less effective as children age past 10

**Best for:** ADHD children under 10 who respond well to narrative content. Not ideal for children who need help focusing or regulating during the day.

**Price:** £39.99/year or £7.99/month

### Calm Kids

**What it is:** Children's section of the popular adult Calm app. Guided meditations, Sleep Stories, and breathing exercises organised by emotional themes.

**ADHD suitability: Poor**

Calm is beautifully designed. The production quality is exceptional. And it's almost entirely wrong for ADHD children.

Why? Because Calm is built around guided meditation. Guided meditation requires following instructions, sustaining attention, and engaging with visualisation exercises. These are executive function tasks, and executive function is precisely what ADHD children struggle with.

**Works WITH the ADHD brain:**
- High production quality holds initial attention
- Sleep Stories are passively consumed
- Programme organisation by emotion helps parents choose

**Fights the ADHD brain:**
- Guided meditation requires instruction-following
- Breathing exercises demand sustained focus
- Interactive elements require cognitive engagement
- US-centric content may feel unfamiliar to UK children
- Higher price point than UK alternatives

**Best for:** Neurotypical children, or ADHD children with mild symptoms who can engage with guided content. Not recommended for children who struggle with instruction-following during dysregulation.

**Price:** £52.99/year or £10.49/month

### Headspace for Kids

**What it is:** Children's content from meditation app Headspace. Guided meditations for three age groups (under 5, 6-8, 10-12), plus Sesame Workshop collaboration content.

**ADHD suitability: Poor**

Headspace has clinical credibility. Co-founder Andy Puddicombe trained as a Buddhist monk for over a decade. The advisory board includes genuine experts. None of that matters if the app fights your child's neurology.

Headspace teaches meditation. It's designed to build a skill over time. But ADHD children don't need to learn meditation during a meltdown or at bedtime when their brain won't stop. They need immediate relief without learning anything.

The structured programmes and family plans assume regular, consistent practice. That consistency is exactly what ADHD families struggle to maintain.

**Works WITH the ADHD brain:**
- Some content is broken into short sessions
- Sesame Street content is familiar and comforting
- Age-appropriate content selection

**Fights the ADHD brain:**
- Teaching approach requires attention and practice
- Traditional mindfulness assumes neurotypical processing
- Structured programmes need consistent use
- US-based content and accents
- Highest price point in category

**Best for:** Families who want to teach meditation as a long-term skill, with children who can engage with instruction-based content. Not recommended for acute calming needs or children with significant attention difficulties.

**Price:** £69.99/year individual, £99.99/year family plan

### Smiling Mind

**What it is:** Free, not-for-profit meditation app from Australia. Over 700 lessons across 50+ collections. Completely free, no premium tier.

**ADHD suitability: Limited**

The price is right. Free removes any barrier to trying it. But "free" doesn't mean "works for ADHD children."

Smiling Mind is a general mental fitness app. It wasn't designed for neurodivergent children at all. The meditation content follows traditional mindfulness approaches that assume your child can follow instructions and sustain attention.

UK parents also report that the Australian voices and references don't always land with their children. When you're trying to calm an ADHD child at 11pm, unfamiliar accents can become unexpected friction.

**Works WITH the ADHD brain:**
- Free removes financial barrier
- Session lengths are customisable (3-25 minutes)
- Offline downloading means no buffering interruptions
- Dark mode reduces evening stimulation

**Fights the ADHD brain:**
- Traditional meditation requires instruction-following
- Australian content may feel unfamiliar
- Technical issues reported (random logouts, streaming problems)
- Interface can be overwhelming
- Not designed for ND children

**Best for:** Families who want to try meditation-style content without financial commitment. As a free option for ADHD-specific calming, The Open Sanctuary (below) is more suitable.

**Price:** Free

### HushAway (The Open Sanctuary)

**What it is:** UK-created platform designed specifically for neurodivergent children. 22+ sound formats including ASMR, frequencies, binaural beats, and stories. The Open Sanctuary is a curated collection you can explore without barriers.

**ADHD suitability: Excellent**

We need to be transparent here: HushAway is what we created. We built it because the apps above didn't work for the children who needed them most. We're parents too, and we were tired of downloading "calming" apps that made bedtime harder.

Everything about HushAway was designed for how ADHD brains actually work:

**Immediate engagement:** Press play. That's it. No content selection during dysregulation. No decisions when executive function is offline. The sound starts immediately.

**Passive listening:** Nothing requires your child to follow instructions, make choices, or sustain attention. The sound works whether your child is actively listening or not.

**Frequency-based sounds:** Binaural beats and solfeggio frequencies work directly with the nervous system. Early research suggests these can support focus and calm without requiring cognitive engagement. This approach works WITH the brain's natural rhythms rather than fighting them.

**Novelty without overwhelm:** 22+ sound formats mean your child won't get bored, but the sounds themselves are sensory-safe. No sudden changes, no unexpected triggers.

**Works WITH the ADHD brain:**
- Zero-demand passive listening
- Frequency-based sounds (binaural beats, solfeggio)
- ASMR content designed for sensory differences
- Immediate engagement, no setup required
- UK-created with UK voices
- Free tier (The Open Sanctuary) for exploration
- Works across all use cases (sleep, focus, regulation, meltdown recovery)

**Limitations:**
- Newer platform, smaller content library than established apps
- Brand new to market, building social proof

**Best for:** ADHD children of any age who need calming support that works without demands. Parents tell us it's particularly helpful for sleep onset, after-school regulation, and meltdown recovery.

**Price:** You can explore The Open Sanctuary and see if it works for your child. The full library is available via subscription.

## How to Choose the Right ADHD Sleep App

Sleep problems are where many parents first look for ADHD apps. The statistics paint a clear picture: up to half of ADHD children struggle with sleep onset, and poor sleep makes ADHD symptoms worse the next day. It's a vicious cycle that exhausts the whole family.

When choosing an ADHD sleep app specifically, ask:

**Does it require following instructions?** If your child can't follow "breathe in for four counts" at 2pm, they definitely won't manage it at 10pm when their brain is racing. Choose passive content.

**Does it need to be set up each night?** ADHD families know that executive function depletes throughout the day. By 9pm, you're both running on empty. An app that requires decisions and navigation at bedtime adds friction exactly when you can't afford it.

**Does it work immediately?** "Give it two weeks" advice ignores ADHD reality. You need something that helps tonight. Not eventually. Tonight.

**Can it become part of a routine?** Predictability helps ADHD children. An app that offers consistent "bedtime sounds" rather than constantly changing content supports routine building.

Based on these criteria, Moshi and HushAway perform best for ADHD sleep specifically. Calm and Headspace's guided approaches work against sleep onset for many ADHD children.

## Why Most "ADHD Focus Apps" Don't Work for Children

Parents often search for ADHD focus app children options, hoping to help with homework or daytime concentration. Most of what you'll find is designed for ADHD adults, not children.

Adult focus apps assume you can choose to engage with them. Children with ADHD during homework time often can't make that choice. The executive function required to start the app is the same executive function that's making homework difficult.

What actually helps ADHD focus:

**Background sounds, not active engagement.** Binaural beats or consistent ambient sound can help some ADHD children focus without requiring them to do anything. They just need to be playing.

**No notifications or interruptions.** Any app that pings or prompts destroys ADHD focus. Choose content that plays continuously without interaction.

**Immediate availability.** If it takes three minutes to set up, you've lost the focus window. One tap, sound plays, focus supported.

HushAway's binaural beats and brainwave content were designed specifically for this. Parents tell us they play them during homework time and notice a difference for children who respond to sound-based focus support.

## Understanding Why Generic Apps Fail ADHD Children

If you've tried other calming apps without success, read our guide on [why generic calming apps fail neurodivergent children](/why-generic-calming-apps-fail-nd-children). The short version: they were designed for different brains.

ADHD diagnoses in the UK have increased substantially over the past decade (BMJ Archives of Disease in Childhood, 2024: [ADHD prevalence and diagnosis in UK children](https://adc.bmj.com/content/109/2/138)). More families than ever are looking for support. Yet most calming apps still treat ADHD children as an afterthought.

The issue isn't that Calm or Headspace are bad apps. They're well-designed for their intended audience. The problem is that intended audience was never ADHD children. Features like "follow these instructions" and "complete this programme" actively work against how ADHD brains function.

For a more detailed look at how the big three apps compare for neurodivergent children, see our [detailed comparison of Moshi, Calm, and Headspace](/honest-comparison-moshi-vs-calm-vs-headspace-nd-kids).

## Quick Comparison: ADHD Apps for Kids UK

| App | ADHD Suitability | Passive Listening | UK-Based | Free Tier | Best For |
|-----|------------------|-------------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Moshi Kids | Mixed | Yes (during playback) | Yes | Trial only | Under 10s, bedtime |
| Calm Kids | Poor | Partial | No | No | Neurotypical children |
| Headspace Kids | Poor | No | No | No | Teaching meditation |
| Smiling Mind | Limited | No | No (Australia) | Yes (full) | Budget exploration |
| HushAway | Excellent | Yes (always) | Yes | Yes (Open Sanctuary) | All ADHD use cases |

## What to Try Tonight

If you're reading this at 9pm with a child who won't sleep, here's what to do right now:

**If you want something to try immediately:** Visit The Open Sanctuary and pick any sound in the sleep category. Press play. That's it. No decisions, no setup, no learning curve.

**If your child likes stories:** Moshi's sleep stories work for many ADHD children, particularly under 10. The passive listening format helps. No interaction required once it starts.

**If instruction-based content has failed before:** Skip Calm and Headspace. They use the same approach that hasn't worked. Choose HushAway's frequency-based sounds or Moshi's passive stories instead.

**If nothing has worked:** Your child isn't broken. You're not failing. Sometimes it takes trying multiple approaches to find what works for your specific child's brain. The Open Sanctuary lets you explore different sound types without pressure.

## The Bottom Line

Most ADHD apps for kids weren't designed for ADHD brains. They adapt neurotypical content and hope it works. For many families, it doesn't.

The apps that actually help share common characteristics: immediate engagement, passive listening, no instruction-following required. They work WITH the racing brain, not against it.

We built HushAway because those apps didn't exist when we needed them. If your ADHD child has struggled with generic calming apps, consider trying something designed for their brain from the start. The Open Sanctuary lets you explore without commitment.

## FAQ

### Do ADHD apps actually work for children?

Some do, some don't. Apps requiring instruction-following or sustained attention often fail because they demand exactly what ADHD children struggle with. Passive listening apps that work without cognitive effort tend to be more effective. The best ADHD apps for kids are designed around how ADHD brains function, not adapted from neurotypical content.

### What's the best free ADHD calming app for kids in the UK?

For ADHD-specific design, HushAway's Open Sanctuary offers frequency-based sounds and passive listening designed for neurodivergent children. It's UK-created and built specifically for how ADHD brains work. Smiling Mind is also free but uses traditional meditation approaches that may not suit ADHD children.

### Why doesn't meditation work for my ADHD child?

Traditional meditation requires sustained attention, following instructions, and engaging with visualisation. These are executive function tasks, and executive function is precisely what's impaired in ADHD. Your child isn't failing at meditation. Meditation is asking things their brain can't consistently provide. Passive listening approaches that don't require cognitive engagement often work better.

### How do I help my ADHD child sleep?

Focus on reducing demands at bedtime. Choose calming sounds or stories that play without requiring your child to do anything. Avoid apps that require setup, decisions, or instruction-following when executive function is lowest. Binaural beats and frequency-based sounds can help some ADHD children by working directly with the nervous system rather than requiring cognitive engagement.

### Is there an ADHD focus app for children that works?

Apps designed for adult focus rarely work for children. Look for background sound options (binaural beats, ambient sounds) that play continuously without interaction. The sound should support focus without requiring attention to manage it. HushAway's binaural and brainwave content works this way, playing quietly in the background during homework or focused tasks. You can explore these sounds in The Open Sanctuary.
