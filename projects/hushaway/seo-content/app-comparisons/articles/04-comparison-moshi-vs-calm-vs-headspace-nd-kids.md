## The Question Every ND Parent Asks

Five stars. Thousands of glowing reviews. "Our children LOVE it!" "Finally, peaceful bedtimes!"

So why won't it work for your child?

If you're comparing Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace as the parent of a neurodivergent child, you've probably downloaded all three at some point. Maybe during a particularly brutal bedtime week. Maybe after yet another evening of your child's racing brain refusing to switch off. Maybe because someone at the school gates mentioned one of them and you thought, "Worth a try."

And then... nothing. Or worse than nothing. Your autistic child covered their ears at the guided voice. Your ADHD child lasted thirty seconds before announcing it was "boring." The app that was supposed to create calm created another argument instead.

Here's what those glowing reviews won't tell you: Moshi, Calm, and Headspace were all designed for neurotypical children. Every single one of them. They weren't built for the children who need calming support most. They were built for easier children and marketed to yours.

We've written about [why generic calming apps fail neurodivergent children](/why-generic-calming-apps-fail-nd-children) in detail. This article is about something more specific: comparing the Big 3 through a neurodivergent lens, and introducing the fourth option you probably didn't know existed.

## What Neurodivergent Children Actually Need

Before we compare Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace, you need to understand what we're actually measuring. Generic app reviews focus on content quality, production values, and "child engagement." Those metrics miss the point entirely for ND children.

What matters for neurodivergent children is whether the app works during the moments it's needed most.

### The Moments That Matter

Your child isn't struggling at 3pm when they're regulated and happy. They're struggling at 9pm when their brain won't stop. Or during a meltdown when nothing makes sense. Or in the car when sensory overload has tipped them over the edge.

During these moments, neurodivergent children typically can't:

**Follow instructions.** According to NICE guidance on ADHD, executive function difficulties mean ADHD children struggle with working memory and self-control, particularly during stress (NICE, 2024: [Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: diagnosis and management](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng87)). "Breathe in for four counts" assumes executive function that's already offline.

**Make decisions.** The National Autistic Society, 2024: [Sensory Differences](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/sensory-differences/sensory-differences/all-audiences) explains that autistic individuals can become overwhelmed by sensory input and processing demands. Asking an overwhelmed child to choose between story options adds another demand to an already overloaded system.

**Tolerate unpredictability.** Sudden volume changes, unfamiliar voices, unexpected sound effects. What seems harmless to neurotypical ears can feel alarming to sensory-sensitive children.

**Engage with interactive elements.** Tapping, swiping, selecting. Every interaction is cognitive load when your child's resources are already depleted.

This is the lens we'll use to evaluate the Big 3. Not "is this a good app?" but "does this work when my ND child actually needs it?"

## Moshi Kids Review for ND Children

**Price:** £39.99/year or £7.99/month
**Free tier:** 7-day trial only
**Origin:** UK (Mind Candy Ltd.)

### What Moshi Gets Right

Of the Big 3, Moshi comes closest to understanding what neurodivergent children need. The Moshi kids review that matters isn't about production quality. It's about whether the app works for how ND brains function.

**Passive listening works.** Once a Moshi story starts, it plays. Your child doesn't need to follow instructions, make choices, or interact with anything. The narration carries them. For children who can't engage with guided meditation, this passive approach is significantly better.

**UK voices and context.** Patrick Stewart, Brian Blessed, Goldie Hawn. These aren't American voices with American references. For UK neurodivergent children who struggle with unfamiliar accents, this matters more than most reviews acknowledge.

**Heart-rate synced audio.** Moshi's sleep stories use soundtracks designed to gradually lower heart rate. This physiological approach doesn't require cognitive engagement. The nervous system responds whether or not your child is actively listening.

**Story-driven rather than instruction-driven.** "Close your eyes and imagine a peaceful place" requires your child to do something. "Once upon a time, there was a sleepy dragon..." just asks them to listen. For many ND children, this difference changes everything.

### Where Moshi Falls Short

**Not designed for neurodivergent children.** This is the fundamental issue. Moshi was built for all children. Some ND children find content that works through trial and error. But the app doesn't distinguish between sensory-safe and potentially overwhelming content.

**Content selection requires decisions.** The library is huge: 400+ stories, meditations, and sounds. When your child is dysregulated at 9pm, navigating this library to find the right content adds friction exactly when you can't afford it. You end up making the choice, which defeats the "just press play" ideal.

**Variable sensory safety.** Some Moshi content is gentle and predictable. Other content has dramatic moments, sound effects, or narrator voices that change pace suddenly. Without preview, you might land on something that triggers rather than soothes.

**Age ceiling around 10-11.** Parents consistently report that Moshi becomes less effective as children approach secondary school age. The storytelling style feels too young. This leaves older ND children without an option in the Moshi ecosystem.

**No frequency-based sounds.** Binaural beats, solfeggio frequencies, and other sound modalities that research suggests may support nervous system regulation aren't part of Moshi's approach. If your child responds to frequencies rather than narrative, Moshi won't help.

### Moshi Verdict for ND Children

**Best for:** Younger neurodivergent children (under 10) who respond to story-based content and have moderate sensory sensitivities. Parents willing to preview and curate content.

**Not suitable for:** Highly sensory-sensitive children, children who need help beyond sleep, children over 10-11, or families who need something that works immediately without curation.

**ND suitability score:** 6/10. Better than most, but not designed for ND needs.

## Calm Kids Review for ND Children

**Price:** £52.99/year or £10.49/month
**Free tier:** None (subscription only)
**Origin:** USA (San Francisco)

### What Calm Gets Right

Calm deserves its reputation. There's a reason millions of families use it successfully.

The app has the highest production quality of the Big 3. The Sleep Stories are beautifully produced. The celebrity narrators (including Stephen Fry and Matthew McConaughey) are genuinely engaging. The app won Apple's App of the Year in 2017, and for many neurotypical children, it's genuinely excellent.

**Organisation by emotional theme.** Content is grouped by what children might be feeling: anxious, restless, trouble sleeping. This thoughtful organisation makes it easy for parents to find relevant content quickly.

**High production standards.** If your child can engage with guided content, Calm delivers it professionally. The soundscapes are polished. The pacing is deliberate. The narration is warm and well-executed.

**Wide content library.** The sheer variety means there's likely something that appeals to most children's interests and preferences.

### Where Calm Falls Short for ND Children

None of this means Calm is a bad app. It isn't. But for many neurodivergent children specifically, the core approach can work against how their brains function.

**Guided meditation requires instruction-following.** This is Calm's core model. A voice guides your child through breathing exercises, visualisations, and mindfulness techniques. The app assumes your child can follow these instructions. Many ND children cannot, especially during the moments they need support most.

**Interactive engagement required.** Calm isn't passive. The guided content asks children to participate: breathe this way, imagine that, notice this sensation. During dysregulation, every demand makes regulation harder.

**American content, American context.** The accents, references, and cultural assumptions are US-centric. For UK neurodivergent children who find unfamiliar accents disconcerting, this creates additional processing load.

**No free tier.** You can't test whether Calm suits your child without paying. For families who've already tried apps that failed, this subscription-first model adds risk.

**Highest cognitive demands of the Big 3.** Research on ADHD sleep difficulties shows that racing thoughts are the primary barrier to sleep onset (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2019: [Sleep disturbances in adolescents with ADHD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6534423/)). Asking a child with racing thoughts to follow meditation instructions adds cognitive demands during moments when cognitive resources are already depleted.

### Calm Verdict for ND Children

**Best for:** Neurotypical children, or neurodivergent children with mild attention differences who can engage with instruction-based content when already fairly regulated.

**Not suitable for:** Autistic children with sensory sensitivities, ADHD children who can't follow instructions during dysregulation, or any ND child who needs support during acute distress.

**ND suitability score:** 3/10. Beautiful app, wrong approach for ND brains.

## Headspace for Kids Review for ND Children

**Price:** £69.99/year individual, £99.99/year family plan
**Free tier:** Very limited
**Origin:** USA (Santa Monica)

### What Headspace Gets Right

Headspace has earned its place as a mindfulness leader. For families who want to build meditation as a long-term skill, it's arguably the best option available.

The clinical credibility is genuine. Co-founder Andy Puddicombe trained as a Buddhist monk for over a decade. The advisory board includes genuine meditation experts. The research backing is solid.

**Age-banded content.** Content is designed for three developmental stages: under 5, 6-8, and 10-12. This thoughtful segmentation acknowledges that children at different ages need different approaches, language, and pacing.

**Sesame Street collaboration.** The "Breathe, Think, Do" content uses familiar characters for younger children. For some ND children, this familiarity with beloved characters reduces anxiety and increases engagement.

**Family plan option.** The subscription covers the whole household, which makes sense for families where parents also want to practice mindfulness. Learning together can strengthen the habit.

**Structured progression.** If your child can engage with the programmes, Headspace builds skills systematically. The progression from beginner to more advanced techniques is well-designed.

### Where Headspace Falls Short for ND Children

The challenge for ND families isn't that Headspace is poorly made. It's that teaching meditation requires cognitive engagement. During the moments your ND child needs support most, cognitive engagement is exactly what they can't provide.

**Teaching model assumes practice over time.** Headspace isn't designed to help tonight. It's designed to build meditation skills gradually. "Give it two weeks" advice doesn't work for ADHD families who need something that helps now.

**Traditional mindfulness assumes neurotypical processing.** Mindfulness techniques were developed for neurotypical brains. The neurodiversity movement has challenged this assumption. As Kapp et al., 2019: [Autistic Community and the Neurodiversity Movement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7082250/) documents, autistic differences are neurological variations, not deficits to be corrected through practices designed for different brains.

**Highest price point.** At £69.99/year (or nearly £100 for family), Headspace is the most expensive option. Given its poor fit for ND children, this represents poor value for most neurodivergent families.

**Structured programmes require consistency.** The app assumes regular practice. ADHD families often struggle with routine consistency. An app that punishes inconsistency through lost progress creates guilt rather than calm.

**No passive option.** Every piece of Headspace content requires engagement. There's nothing for the moments when your child can't engage at all.

### Headspace Verdict for ND Children

**Best for:** Families who want to teach meditation as a long-term skill, used during already-calm periods rather than crises. Neurotypical children, or ND children interested in learning mindfulness as a practice.

**Not suitable for:** ADHD children during acute dysregulation, autistic children during meltdowns, or any situation where immediate passive support is needed.

**ND suitability score:** 2/10. Good meditation app, wrong tool for ND crisis moments.

## The Fourth Option: What If the App Was Designed FOR Them?

Here's the pattern nobody talks about in Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace comparisons: all three started with neurotypical children and adapted (or didn't adapt) for neurodivergent needs later.

Moshi was built for all children. Calm was built for adults, then extended to children. Headspace teaches meditation techniques developed for neurotypical minds. None of them started by asking: "What do neurodivergent children actually need?"

This is the "adapted FOR vs designed FOR" distinction. And it matters more than you might think.

**Adapted FOR** means you take a product built for one audience and modify it for another. The underlying assumptions remain. The design philosophy doesn't change. You're hoping the modifications are enough.

**Designed FOR** means you start from scratch with your target audience's needs. You don't adapt. You build specifically for how their brains work.

### HushAway®: The ND-First Alternative

We built HushAway® because we needed it ourselves. As parents and practitioners supporting neurodivergent children, we'd tried every app on this list. Nothing was designed for our children. So we created something that was.

Is it perfect? No. Is it the right fit for every ND child? Also no. But here's what makes it different.

**Passive listening from day one.** Not passive because it's simpler. Passive because that's what actually works during the hardest moments. When your child is overwhelmed, the last thing they need is another demand. HushAway® works whether your child is actively listening or not. Press play. That's it.

**Sensory-safe by design.** No sudden volume changes. No unexpected sound effects. No unpredictable transitions. Every sound is designed so your child's nervous system can trust it completely.

**Frequency-based sounds.** Solfeggio frequencies, binaural beats, and brainwave content that work with the nervous system directly. Your child doesn't need to follow instructions or engage cognitively. The frequencies do the work.

**Zero-demand principle.** Your child's only job is to exist in the presence of the sound. They don't have to breathe a certain way, visualise anything, or follow along. The sound meets them where they are.

**22+ sound formats.** ASMR for sensory seekers. Frequencies for nervous system regulation. Gentle stories for bedtime. Ambient soundscapes for background calm. The variety addresses different needs without overwhelming choice during crisis moments.

**UK-created with UK voices.** Familiar accents. British context. No transatlantic cognitive load.

**The Open Sanctuary.** A curated collection you can explore without subscription pressure. No trial periods. No credit card required. Just sounds designed for children like yours.

### What Makes ND-First Design Different

When we designed HushAway®, we didn't start with "what makes a good calming app?" We started with "what happens in a neurodivergent child's brain during overwhelm?"

The answer: executive function goes offline. Following instructions becomes impossible. Making choices adds stress. Unpredictable audio triggers rather than soothes. Interactive demands make everything worse.

So we designed the opposite: sound that requires nothing from your child. Sound that's completely predictable. Sound that works without cognitive engagement. Sound that meets dysregulation with zero demands.

This isn't complicated. It's just starting from the right place. The Big 3 apps started elsewhere and tried to stretch to reach ND children. HushAway® started with ND children and built specifically for them.

## Choosing the Right App for Your Child

After reviewing Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace through a neurodivergent lens, here's our honest guidance:

### Choose Moshi if:

Your child is under 10 and responds well to stories. You're willing to preview content and build a playlist of sensory-safe options. Your child has moderate (not severe) sensory sensitivities. You're primarily looking for bedtime support.

### Choose Calm if:

Your child is neurotypical or has very mild attention differences. They can engage with guided meditation when already fairly regulated. You're not looking for crisis support, but for building mindfulness as a skill.

### Choose Headspace if:

You want to teach meditation as a long-term practice. Your child is interested in learning mindfulness techniques. You're willing to invest time in building a consistent practice. You don't need support during acute dysregulation.

### Choose HushAway® if:

Your child is neurodivergent and needs support during the hard moments. Generic calming apps haven't worked before. You need something that works without demands. Your child responds to sound-based calm rather than instruction-based guidance. You want to try something designed specifically for ND children.

## What to Try Tonight

If you're reading this at 9pm with a dysregulated child, here's the practical advice:

**If you already have Moshi:** Find their gentlest sleep content. Avoid anything with "adventure" in the title. Look for consistent, calm narration without dramatic moments.

**If you have Calm or Headspace:** These probably won't help tonight if your child is already overwhelmed. Their guided approach requires regulation to use.

**If you want something different:** The Open Sanctuary might be worth exploring. It's designed for exactly this moment: your child is struggling, you're exhausted, and you need something that works without demands. No subscription needed. No decisions required. Just sounds built from the ground up for neurodivergent children.

For more detailed reviews, see our guides to [best apps for autistic children](/review-best-apps-autistic-children-uk) and [best apps for ADHD children](/review-best-apps-adhd-children-uk). And for the complete picture of all options available, including free alternatives, see our [comprehensive guide to calming apps for neurodivergent children](/guide-best-calming-apps-nd-children-uk).

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child. The right sounds, designed for how your child actually processes the world, can create those moments.

We can't promise HushAway® will work for your child. Every ND child is different, and what soothes one might do nothing for another. But if you've tried the Big 3 and they haven't worked, it might be worth exploring something built specifically for how your child's brain works.

Explore The Open Sanctuary when you're ready.

## FAQ

### Which is better, Moshi or Calm, for a neurodivergent child?

Moshi is better for most neurodivergent children. Moshi's passive listening approach requires less cognitive engagement than Calm's guided meditation. However, neither was designed specifically for ND children. Moshi works for some ND children some of the time, while Calm's instruction-based approach often fails during moments of dysregulation.

### Why doesn't Headspace work for my ADHD child?

Headspace requires instruction-following, sustained attention, and consistent practice. These are executive function tasks, and executive function is exactly what ADHD children struggle with, especially during stress. The app teaches meditation rather than providing immediate calm. It assumes your child can regulate enough to learn regulation techniques, which creates a problematic paradox.

### Is there a calming app designed specifically for neurodivergent children?

HushAway® is a UK platform designed from the ground up for neurodivergent children. While Moshi, Calm, and Headspace were built for neurotypical users and adapted (or not) for ND needs, HushAway® was built specifically for how ND brains process sound and stress. The Open Sanctuary offers a curated collection you can explore without subscription barriers. Whether it works for your specific child depends on their individual needs and preferences.

### What's the difference between "adapted for" and "designed for" neurodivergent children?

"Adapted for" means an app built for neurotypical children was modified to work for ND children. The underlying assumptions remain the same. "Designed for" means the app was built from scratch with ND needs as the starting point. This difference matters because adapted apps often retain features (instruction-following, interaction requirements, unpredictable audio) that don't work for ND brains.

### Can my autistic child use Calm?

Calm's guided meditation approach requires following instructions, tolerating unfamiliar voices, and engaging with visualisation exercises. Many autistic children struggle with these demands, especially during sensory overwhelm or meltdown recovery. Calm works better for neurotypical children or autistic children who can engage with instruction-based content when already regulated. For most autistic children during difficult moments, passive listening approaches work better.
