# Newsletter Snippet: Why Generic Calming Apps Fail Neurodivergent Children

## Hook

You've been there. 9pm. Bedtime was an hour ago. You've downloaded another app because someone swore it worked. Your child lasted thirty seconds. Now you're wondering: what's wrong with them?

Here's the truth nobody tells you: nothing is wrong with your child. Everything is wrong with those apps.

## Body

Every mainstream calming app on the market—Calm, Headspace, Moshi—was designed for neurotypical children. The instructions, the interactions, the pacing. All of it assumes a brain that works one particular way.

When those apps ask your overwhelmed child to "follow instructions to calm down," they're asking them to do the thing they're already struggling to do. For neurodivergent children during overwhelm, the thinking part of their brain goes offline. No amount of "just breathe" brings it back.

The interaction that works for neurotypical children? For ND children, every tap, choice, or response is cognitive load during the exact moment they can't handle demands. The meditation that requires following along? ADHD brains need something to land on—silence makes racing thoughts louder. The visualisation exercises? Literal-minded autistic children can't engage with "imagine your worries as leaves on a stream."

What actually works is passive listening. Sound that requires nothing from your child. No instructions to follow. No choices to make. Just press play. The sound does the work while your child does nothing.

This isn't lazy design. It's smart design for how ND brains actually work during stress.

## CTA

If you've been blaming yourself when calming apps don't work, it's time to stop. The design failed. Not your child. Not you.

## Alternative: Problem-Solution Format

**This week's insight for exhausted ND parents:**

Calming apps don't work for my child. That's the search that brings hundreds of parents to us every week. Exhausted. Confused. Wondering what's wrong.

Here's what's actually happening:

• Most apps were designed for neurotypical children and adapted later
• They require instruction-following during moments when ND brains can't follow instructions
• Interaction creates demands, not calm, during overwhelm
• Meditation fails ADHD (needs stimulation, not silence) and autistic children (needs predictable, sensory-safe design)

The apps you've been trying weren't designed for your child. They were designed for easier children and marketed to yours.

When calming apps don't work, the design failed. Not your child. Not you.

**What works instead:** Passive listening. Zero demands. Just press play. Sounds designed specifically for neurodivergent brains, not adapted from neurotypical content.
