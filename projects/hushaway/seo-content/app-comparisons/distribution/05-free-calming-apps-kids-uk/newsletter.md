# Newsletter Snippet: Free Calming Apps for Kids UK

## Hook

You've downloaded another free calming app. Your child finally finds a sound that works. Then you discover it's locked behind a £7.99/month subscription.

## Body

We hear from parents every week who've gone through exactly this cycle. Downloaded, tried, deleted. Repeat.

Here's the real question: is there actually a free calming app for kids that works? Or is "free" just code for "frustrating"?

The good news: genuinely free options exist. The bad news: most are either generic (designed for neurotypical children) or technically unreliable. For parents of neurodivergent children, the search is even harder. You're looking for free AND designed for your child's brain.

This week's article breaks down the real free options: Smiling Mind (the best-known choice with hidden technical issues), CBeebies Radio (the UK option most parents miss), YouTube (unlimited but risky), and the one free option actually designed for neurodivergent children from the ground up.
