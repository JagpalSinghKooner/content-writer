# Instagram Content: Free Calming Apps for Kids UK

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
FREE CALMING APPS FOR KIDS

The honest truth
(and the ND-first option you didn't know existed)

### Slide 2: The Problem
You've downloaded your fourth free app this month.

One crashed.
One had ads.
One needs a subscription.

Sound familiar?

### Slide 3: What "Free" Actually Means
AD-SUPPORTED
Loud adverts mid-bedtime

FREEMIUM
Best content locked away

DATA-FUNDED
Your family is the product

GENUINELY FREE
Rare

### Slide 4: Smiling Mind
The best-known free option

✓ 700+ meditations, zero cost
✓ No ads or upselling

✗ Technical reliability issues
✗ Australian content
✗ Designed for neurotypical children

### Slide 5: CBeebies Radio
The hidden UK option

✓ Free via BBC Sounds
✓ Familiar UK voices
✓ No adverts

✗ Limited calming content
✗ Stories rotate
✗ Not designed for ND children

### Slide 6: YouTube
Unlimited but risky

✗ Adverts interrupt calm
✗ Autoplay chaos
✗ Inconsistent quality
✗ Screen required
✗ Unpredictable

### Slide 7: The ND-First Free Option
The Open Sanctuary by HushAway®

✓ Designed FOR neurodivergent children
✓ Passive listening
✓ Sensory-safe audio
✓ UK-created
✓ Free forever

### Slide 8: Which Works for YOUR Child?
Neurotypical + meditation
→ Smiling Mind

Neurotypical + stories
→ CBeebies Radio

Neurodivergent + passive sound
→ The Open Sanctuary

### Slide 9: The Real Question
Free AND generic?
Easy to find.

Free AND reliable?
Harder.

Free AND designed for neurodivergent children?
Nearly impossible.

Until now.

### Slide 10: CTA
Free doesn't have to mean frustrating.

## Caption

You've downloaded another "free" calming app.

Your child finally finds a sound that works. Then you discover it's locked behind a subscription.

.
.
.

We hear from parents every week who've gone through exactly this cycle. Downloaded, tried, deleted. Repeat.

Here's what nobody tells you about free calming apps: most are either generic (designed for neurotypical children) or technically unreliable. If your child is neurodivergent, you're looking for free AND designed for how their brain actually works.

Most parents assume that combination doesn't exist.

The Open Sanctuary by HushAway® is that combination. Free. Passive listening. Sensory-safe. Frequencies, ASMR, binaural beats designed for neurodivergent children.

Not adapted from neurotypical content. Built from the ground up for ND brains.

Free doesn't have to mean frustrating. When you're ready to try something different, explore The Open Sanctuary.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Stop downloading random free calming apps."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"Here's the honest truth about free options:

Smiling Mind? Free, but crashes mid-bedtime and designed for neurotypical children.

CBeebies Radio? UK voices, but limited calming content and stories disappear.

YouTube? Unlimited chaos with adverts and autoplay.

If your child is neurodivergent, you need free AND designed for ND brains.

That's The Open Sanctuary by HushAway. Passive listening. Sensory-safe. Actually designed for your child."
