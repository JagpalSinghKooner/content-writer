# LinkedIn Content: Free Calming Apps for Kids UK

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
You've downloaded your fourth free calming app this month.

One crashed during bedtime.
Another had ads every two minutes.
The third needs a subscription.

Swipe → for the honest truth about free options

### Slide 2: The Problem
"Free" in the app world often means:

🚫 Ad-supported (loud adverts mid-bedtime)
🚫 Freemium (best content locked away)
🚫 Data-funded (your family is the product)
✓ Genuinely free (rare)

### Slide 3: Smiling Mind
The best-known free option.

✓ 700+ meditations, zero cost
✓ No ads, no upselling
✗ Technical reliability issues
✗ Australian content/accents
✗ Designed for neurotypical children

### Slide 4: CBeebies Radio
The hidden free option.

✓ Completely free (BBC licence)
✓ Familiar UK voices
✓ No adverts
✗ Limited calming content
✗ Stories rotate (may disappear)
✗ Not designed for ND children

### Slide 5: YouTube
Unlimited but risky.

✗ Adverts interrupt calm
✗ Autoplay chaos
✗ Wildly inconsistent quality
✗ Screen required
✗ Unpredictable (sensory nightmare)

### Slide 6: The ND-First Free Option
The Open Sanctuary by HushAway®

✓ Designed FOR neurodivergent children
✓ Passive listening (no interaction)
✓ Sensory-safe audio
✓ Frequencies, ASMR, binaural beats
✓ UK-created
✓ Free forever

### Slide 7: Quick Comparison
Which works for YOUR child?

Neurotypical + guided meditation → Smiling Mind
Neurotypical + stories → CBeebies Radio
Neurodivergent + passive sound → The Open Sanctuary

### Slide 8: CTA
Free AND designed for ND children?

That combination barely exists.

Until now.

## Text Post 1

You've downloaded another "free" calming app.

Your child finally finds a sound that works. Then you discover it's locked behind a £7.99/month subscription.

Sound familiar?

Here's what nobody tells you about free calming apps:

**Smiling Mind** is genuinely free. Over 700 meditations. No ads. But it's Australian content designed for neurotypical children, and the technical reliability issues are real. Random logouts mid-session. Streaming interruptions when your child needs consistency most.

**CBeebies Radio** through BBC Sounds is ad-free and UK voices your child already knows. But it's stories, not specifically calming content. And stories rotate. Something that works tonight might disappear next month.

**YouTube** has unlimited content. It also has adverts that destroy calm, autoplay that leads to chaos, and inconsistent audio quality that creates sensory problems rather than solving them.

If your child is neurodivergent, the search gets harder. You're looking for free AND designed for how their brain actually works.

Most parents assume that combination doesn't exist.

The Open Sanctuary by HushAway® is that combination. Free. Passive listening. Sensory-safe. Frequencies, ASMR, binaural beats designed for neurodivergent children. No subscription. No trial that expires. Just sounds that work.

Not adapted from neurotypical content. Built from the ground up for ND brains.

Free doesn't have to mean frustrating. It doesn't have to mean generic.

When you're ready to try something different, explore The Open Sanctuary.

"Why don't free calming apps work for my ADHD child?"

I hear this question every week.

The answer is simpler than you think.

Most free meditation apps use guided exercises. "Breathe in. Now breathe out. Imagine a peaceful place."

For an ADHD brain? That's impossible during stress.

Guided meditation requires:
→ Instruction-following
→ Sustained attention
→ Cognitive engagement

All three are exactly what an ADHD brain struggles with during overwhelm.

It's not that your child won't try. It's that the app is asking for something their nervous system can't give in that moment.

The same pattern repeats with autistic children. Visualisation exercises. Interactive elements. Choices during moments when choices feel impossible.

Generic apps assume neurotypical processing. Then ND children "fail" to use them. But the children didn't fail. The design failed the children.

What actually works for ND children?

**Passive listening.** No instructions. No choices. No interaction.
**Sensory-safe audio.** No sudden changes. Predictable. Trustworthy.
**Frequency-based options.** Sound that works with the nervous system directly, not through cognitive instruction.

That's why The Open Sanctuary exists. It's free. It's designed for neurodivergent children. And it doesn't ask your child to do anything except press play.

Your child isn't broken. The apps they've tried just weren't built for them.

If you've tried free calming apps that didn't work, the problem probably wasn't "free."

The problem was design.
