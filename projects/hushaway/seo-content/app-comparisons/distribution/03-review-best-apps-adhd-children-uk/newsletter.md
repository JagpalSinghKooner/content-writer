# Newsletter Snippet: Best Apps for ADHD Children UK

## Hook

It's 10:47pm. Your ADHD child is wired, restless, nowhere near sleep. You've tried the "best" calming apps—the ones with thousands of five-star reviews, the ones other parents swear by. They don't work for your child.

Here's what those apps won't tell you: they weren't designed for ADHD brains at all.

## Body

I tested the most popular calming apps through an ADHD-specific lens. Not which apps claim to help, but which ones actually work WITH the racing brain instead of fighting it.

**The problem:** Most calming apps require exactly what ADHD children struggle with most—sustained attention, following instructions, and delayed gratification. Calm and Headspace scored POOR for ADHD suitability because they're built around guided meditation and instruction-following. Moshi scored MIXED—good for passive listening, but content selection becomes overwhelming during dysregulation.

**What works:** Apps designed specifically for how ADHD brains function. Immediate engagement without demands. Passive listening that works without cognitive effort. Frequency-based sounds (binaural beats, solfeggio frequencies) that work directly with the nervous system. No instruction-following required. No "give it two weeks" advice.

**The insight:** If your child can't calm down enough to use a calming app, the problem isn't your child. The problem is the app wasn't designed for their neurology.

## CTA

I've reviewed Moshi, Calm, Headspace, Smiling Mind, and HushAway (full transparency: we created HushAway specifically for ADHD and neurodivergent children). Only one was built for ADHD brains from the start.
