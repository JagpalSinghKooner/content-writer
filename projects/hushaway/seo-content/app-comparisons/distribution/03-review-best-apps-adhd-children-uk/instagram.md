# Instagram Content: Best Apps for ADHD Children UK

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
Your ADHD child won't use
the "best" calming app.

It's not their fault.

Swipe to see why →

### Slide 2: The Problem
Those 5-star apps?

They were designed for neurotypical children.

Then marketed to ADHD families as an afterthought.

They require exactly what ADHD brains can't give during dysregulation.

### Slide 3: What Doesn't Work
❌ "Focus on your breath"
❌ "Follow these steps"
❌ "Complete this programme"
❌ "Give it two weeks"

These all require executive function.

Executive function is what's impaired in ADHD.

### Slide 4: What ADHD Brains Need
✓ Immediate engagement
   (works tonight, not next week)

✓ Passive listening
   (no interaction required)

✓ Zero cognitive demands
   (no instruction-following)

✓ Novelty without overwhelm
   (interesting but calm)

### Slide 5: Moshi Kids
MIXED for ADHD

✓ Passive listening once started
✓ Engaging narrators
✓ UK-based content

✗ Content selection requires decisions
✗ Some stories too long
✗ No frequency-based sounds

**Best for:** Under 10s, bedtime

### Slide 6: Calm & Headspace
POOR for ADHD

Both require:
• Instruction-following
• Sustained attention
• Interactive engagement
• Delayed results

Beautiful apps.
Wrong neurology.

**Best for:** Neurotypical children

### Slide 7: HushAway
EXCELLENT for ADHD

✓ Zero-demand passive listening
✓ Frequency-based sounds
✓ ASMR for sensory differences
✓ Immediate engagement
✓ Free tier to explore

**Best for:** All ADHD use cases

### Slide 8: The Pattern
Apps that work for ADHD share these:

• Passive listening (always)
• Immediate engagement (tonight)
• No instruction-following
• No setup during dysregulation
• UK voices and content

Only one app has all five.

### Slide 9: Why It Matters
25-50% of ADHD children struggle with sleep (NICE, 2024).

That's half of all ADHD children.

Not because they don't want calm.

Because their brains don't have an off switch.

They need different tools.

### Slide 10: CTA
If your ADHD child has struggled with calming apps before...

They're not the problem.

The apps are.

Try something designed for their brain from the start 💜

## Caption

Your ADHD child won't use Calm or Headspace. And it's not their fault.

.
.
.

I tested every "best calming app" list through an ADHD-specific lens. Not which apps claim to help, but which ones actually work when a child's brain won't switch off at 10:47pm.

Most apps scored POOR for ADHD suitability. Why? They require instruction-following, sustained attention, and delayed gratification—exactly what ADHD children struggle with.

Calm and Headspace are beautifully designed. For neurotypical brains. They use guided meditation and breathing exercises that demand cognitive engagement during dysregulation.

Moshi scored MIXED. Passive listening helps, but content selection becomes overwhelming when executive function is offline.

Only HushAway scored EXCELLENT—because everything was designed around how ADHD brains work from the start. Frequency-based sounds (binaural beats, solfeggio). ASMR for sensory differences. Passive listening with zero demands. Immediate engagement, no setup required.

The difference? One was built FOR ADHD brains. The others adapted neurotypical content and hoped it worked.

If your child can't calm down enough to use a calming app, the problem isn't your child. The problem is the app wasn't designed for their neurology.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your ADHD child won't use Calm or Headspace. Here's why."

[Visual: Parent looking exhausted at phone screen showing app]

**[3-20 seconds: VALUE]**
"Those apps require:
• Following instructions
• Sustained attention
• Delayed results

But ADHD brains during dysregulation can't give any of those.

They need:
• Passive listening
• Immediate engagement
• Zero cognitive demands

Most calming apps fight the ADHD brain.
HushAway works WITH it."

"If calming apps haven't worked for your child, they're not the problem.
