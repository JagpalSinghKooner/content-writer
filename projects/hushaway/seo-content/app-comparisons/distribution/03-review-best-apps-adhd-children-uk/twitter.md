# Twitter/X Content: Best Apps for ADHD Children UK

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Your ADHD child won't use Calm or Headspace.

Not because they're difficult.

Because those apps weren't designed for ADHD brains.

I tested every "best calming app" through an ADHD lens.

Here's what actually works 🧵

### Tweet 2
The ADHD brain problem:

At bedtime, neurotypical brains wind down naturally.

ADHD brains become MORE active.

25-50% of ADHD children struggle with sleep (NICE, 2024).

Any app requiring "focus on your breath" has already failed.

### Tweet 3
What ADHD children actually need from an app:

• Immediate engagement (no waiting)
• Passive listening (no interaction required)
• Novelty without overwhelm
• Works tonight, not "after 10 sessions"

Most apps fail these tests.

Moshi Kids: MIXED for ADHD

✓ Passive listening once started
✓ Engaging narrators
✓ UK-based

✗ Content selection requires decisions during dysregulation
✗ Some stories too long for ADHD attention spans
✗ No frequency-based sounds

Best for: Under 10s, bedtime
£39.99/year

### Tweet 5
Calm Kids: POOR for ADHD

✓ High production quality
✓ Sleep stories are passive

✗ Guided meditation requires instruction-following
✗ Breathing exercises demand sustained focus
✗ Interactive elements need cognitive engagement

Best for: Neurotypical children
£52.99/year

### Tweet 6
Headspace Kids: POOR for ADHD

✓ Sesame Street content is familiar

✗ Teaching approach requires attention and practice
✗ Traditional mindfulness assumes neurotypical processing
✗ Structured programmes need consistent use

Best for: Teaching meditation long-term
£69.99/year

### Tweet 7
HushAway: EXCELLENT for ADHD

✓ Zero-demand passive listening
✓ Frequency-based sounds (binaural beats, solfeggio)
✓ ASMR designed for sensory differences
✓ Immediate engagement, no setup
✓ Free tier (The Open Sanctuary)

Best for: All ADHD use cases
Free exploration available

### Tweet 8
The pattern:

Apps built FOR neurotypical children (Calm, Headspace) require instruction-following and sustained attention.

Apps adapted FOR ADHD (HushAway) offer passive listening with zero cognitive demands.

One group is 10x bigger. Guess which gets the app development budget?

### Tweet 9
Why most "ADHD focus apps" don't work:

They're designed for ADHD adults, not children.

They assume you can CHOOSE to engage with them.

ADHD children during homework time often can't make that choice.

The executive function required to start the app is the same one making homework difficult.

### Tweet 10
What actually helps ADHD focus:

Background sounds playing continuously without interaction.

• Binaural beats
• Brainwave frequencies
• Consistent ambient sound

No notifications. No prompts. No setup.

Just playing quietly during homework time.

### Tweet 11
If meditation hasn't worked for your ADHD child:

You haven't failed.

Meditation REQUIRES executive function (following instructions, sustaining attention, engaging with visualisation).

Executive function is what's impaired in ADHD.

You need a different approach.

### Tweet 12
Quick comparison — ADHD suitability:

Moshi: Mixed
Calm: Poor
Headspace: Poor
Smiling Mind: Limited
HushAway: Excellent

The difference? HushAway was built for ADHD brains from the start.

The others adapted neurotypical content and hoped it worked.

### Tweet 13 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Most calming apps fight the ADHD brain
• They require instruction-following and sustained focus
• Passive listening apps work better
• Frequency-based sounds (binaural beats) support regulation without demands
• Try HushAway's Open Sanctuary free

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Hot Take)
Unpopular opinion:

If your ADHD child can't use a "calming app," the problem isn't your child.

The problem is the app wasn't designed for their brain.

Most calming apps require the exact executive function ADHD children don't have.

### Tweet B (Insight)
Most people think ADHD children need to "learn to focus."

But apps requiring focus during dysregulation are asking for the thing that's offline.

Passive listening works better: binaural beats, frequencies, ASMR.

Zero cognitive demands. Just press play.

### Tweet C (Data Point)
25-50% of ADHD children struggle with sleep (NICE, 2024).

Yet most "sleep apps" require:
• Following instructions
• Making choices at bedtime
• Sustained attention to meditation

They're solving the wrong problem.

### Tweet D (List)
5 things calming apps get wrong for ADHD children:

• Require instruction-following
• Need setup during dysregulation
• Ask for sustained attention
• Demand delayed gratification
• Built for neurotypical brains, adapted later

No wonder they don't work.

### Tweet E (Question)
Why do ADHD children's brains become MORE active at bedtime while neurotypical brains wind down?

It's why "focus on your breath" meditation fails exactly when parents need it most.

Passive listening (stories, frequencies) works better. No focus required.
