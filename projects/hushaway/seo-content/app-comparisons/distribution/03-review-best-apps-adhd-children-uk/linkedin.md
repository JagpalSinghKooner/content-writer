# LinkedIn Content: Best Apps for ADHD Children UK

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Hook
Most "calming apps" make ADHD worse.

Here's what actually works
(and why those 5-star apps don't)

Swipe →

### Slide 2: The Problem
Your ADHD child won't use the app everyone recommends.

Not because they're difficult.

Because the app requires exactly what ADHD brains can't give: following instructions, sustained focus, delayed gratification.

### Slide 3: What ADHD Brains Actually Need
❌ "Focus on your breath"
❌ "Follow these steps"
❌ "Complete this programme"

✓ Immediate engagement
✓ Passive listening
✓ Zero cognitive demands
✓ Works tonight, not next week

### Slide 4: Moshi Kids
✓ Passive listening once started
✓ Engaging narrators hold attention
✓ Sleep stories help racing thoughts

✗ Content selection requires decisions
✗ Some stories too long for ADHD
✗ No frequency-based sounds

**Best for:** Under 10s, bedtime
**Price:** £39.99/year

### Slide 5: Calm Kids
✓ High production quality
✓ Sleep stories are passively consumed

✗ Guided meditation requires instruction-following
✗ Breathing exercises demand sustained focus
✗ Interactive elements need cognitive engagement

**Best for:** Neurotypical children
**Price:** £52.99/year

### Slide 6: Headspace Kids
✓ Short sessions available
✓ Age-appropriate content

✗ Teaching approach requires attention
✗ Traditional mindfulness assumes neurotypical processing
✗ Structured programmes need consistent use

**Best for:** Teaching meditation long-term
**Price:** £69.99/year

### Slide 7: HushAway
✓ Zero-demand passive listening
✓ Frequency-based sounds (binaural beats, solfeggio)
✓ ASMR designed for sensory differences
✓ Immediate engagement, no setup
✓ Free tier (The Open Sanctuary)

✗ Newer platform, smaller library

**Best for:** ADHD children of any age
**Price:** Free exploration available

### Slide 8: The Pattern
Apps that work for ADHD children share these characteristics:

• Passive listening (no interaction required)
• Immediate engagement (works tonight)
• No instruction-following needed
• No setup during dysregulation
• UK voices and content

### Slide 9: Quick Comparison
**ADHD Suitability:**
• Moshi: Mixed
• Calm: Poor
• Headspace: Poor
• HushAway: Excellent

The difference? One was built FOR ADHD brains. The others adapted neurotypical content and hoped it worked.

They're not the problem.
The apps are.

Your ADHD child isn't broken because they won't use Calm or Headspace.

Those apps were designed for different brains.

.

I tested the most popular calming apps through an ADHD-specific lens. Not "is this nice?" but "does this work when my child's brain won't switch off at 10:47pm?"

Here's what I found:

**The ADHD Brain Problem:**

NICE guidance shows 25-50% of ADHD children struggle with sleep. That's half. Not because they don't want calm. Because their brains don't have an off switch.

At bedtime, neurotypical brains wind down naturally. ADHD brains often become MORE active as the body tires.

Any app requiring "focus on your breath" or "imagine a peaceful place" has already failed. The ADHD brain can't hold that focus during peak dysregulation.

**What Actually Works:**

• Immediate engagement without demands
• Passive listening, not active participation
• Novelty without overwhelm
• No delayed gratification ("this helps after 10 sessions" doesn't work)

**The Results:**

Most popular apps (Calm, Headspace) scored POOR for ADHD suitability. They're built around guided meditation and instruction-following—exactly what ADHD children struggle with.

Moshi scored MIXED. Good for passive listening, but content selection becomes overwhelming during dysregulation.

HushAway (full disclosure: we created this) scored EXCELLENT because everything was designed around how ADHD brains work—frequency-based sounds, zero demands, immediate engagement.

**The Bottom Line:**

If your child can't calm down enough to use a calming app, the problem isn't your child.

The problem is the app wasn't designed for their brain.

I've tested every "best calming app for ADHD children" list.

Here's what they all get wrong:

.

They review apps based on features, not neurology.

"This app has 500 meditations!" → Doesn't matter if your ADHD child can't follow meditation instructions during dysregulation.

"Thousands of 5-star reviews!" → From neurotypical families. Your experience will be different.

"Clinically proven techniques!" → Proven for neurotypical brains, not ADHD brains.

.

The Real Questions to Ask:

1. Does it require following instructions?
2. Does it need setup or decisions at bedtime?
3. Does it work immediately, or "give it two weeks"?
4. Can it become part of a routine?

.

Most apps fail these tests.

They're adapted from neurotypical content and marketed to ADHD families as an afterthought.

.

If your ADHD child has struggled with the "best" apps, they're not alone.

And they're definitely not the problem.

The apps just weren't built for brains like theirs.

(We changed that with HushAway—designed for ADHD brains from the start. The Open Sanctuary lets you explore without commitment.)

What's your experience with calming apps? What actually worked?

"Why doesn't meditation work for my ADHD child?"

Because meditation REQUIRES the thing ADHD brains struggle with most.

.

Traditional meditation asks children to:
• Follow instructions
• Sustain attention
• Engage with visualisation
• Practice consistently

These are all executive function tasks.

Executive function is precisely what's impaired in ADHD.

Your child isn't failing at meditation.
Meditation is asking things their brain can't consistently provide.

.

This is why Calm and Headspace—both excellent apps for neurotypical children—score POOR for ADHD suitability in my testing.

They're teaching meditation. Building a skill over time.

But ADHD children don't need to learn meditation during a meltdown or at bedtime when their brain won't stop.

They need immediate relief without learning anything.

.

What works instead:

Passive listening approaches that work without cognitive engagement.

• Frequency-based sounds (binaural beats)
• ASMR content (designed for sensory differences)
• Sleep stories (narrative engagement without demands)
• Ambient sounds (consistent, no surprises)

No instruction-following.
No sustained focus required.
Just press play.

.

If meditation hasn't worked for your ADHD child, you haven't failed.

You just need a different approach—one designed for how their brain actually works.

That's why we created HushAway. Passive listening, zero demands, immediate engagement.

Explore The Open Sanctuary to see the difference.
