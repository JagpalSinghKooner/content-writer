✗ Moshi

Your child:
→ Covered their ears
→ Lasted 30 seconds
→ Melted down from choices

Still searching at 2am

### Slide 3: The Pattern
Every mainstream app:

**Built FOR** neurotypical children
↓
**Adapted FOR** ND children later
↓
Original assumptions remain

**This is why they don't work**

### Slide 4: What ND Children Need
❌ Guided meditation
❌ Interactive exercises
❌ Choice-heavy interfaces
❌ Instructions to follow

✓ Passive listening
✓ Sensory-safe sound
✓ Zero demands
✓ Just press play

### Slide 5: The Research
90% of autistic individuals experience sensory sensitivity
(National Autistic Society, 2024)

25-50% of ADHD children have sleep problems
(NICE, 2024)

**ND children need different tools**

### Slide 6: The Options
**Moshi** £40/year
UK-created, adapted FOR ND

**Calm** £53/year
US app, not designed for ND

Teaches meditation, requires engagement

### Slide 7: Free Options
🆓 **The Open Sanctuary**
Only free tier designed FOR ND children from the start

🆓 **Smiling Mind**
700+ meditations, designed for neurotypical processing

### Slide 8: By Need
**Sleep:** Frequencies + passive stories
**Meltdowns:** ASMR + regulation
**Focus:** Binaural beats + ambient
**Transitions:** Predictable routines
**Sensory overload:** Steady sounds

### Slide 9: The Question
"Was this built for my child, or adapted for them?"

That question changes everything

**Adapted =** neurotypical assumptions remain
**Designed for =** respects ND processing from the start

### Slide 10: CTA
One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child

## Caption

Every calming app your child has tried and rejected was built for neurotypical children first.

.
.
.

Calm. Headspace. Moshi. All of them. Designed for children whose brains work one particular way, then adapted for neurodivergent children as an afterthought.

Sometimes that adaptation is thoughtful. Sometimes it's just marketing. The original design assumptions remain either way.

**Here's what those apps assume:**
→ Children can follow instructions during stress
→ Guided meditation helps (not overwhelms)
→ Making choices engages (not exhausts)
→ Active participation is possible when dysregulated

For neurotypical children, these assumptions hold. For ND children, they collapse.

Research shows 90% of autistic individuals experience sensory sensitivity (National Autistic Society, 2024). ADHD children's racing thoughts prevent them from following meditation instructions precisely when they need calm most. The cognitive resources needed to follow guidance go offline during dysregulation.

**What ND children actually need:**
→ Passive listening (no interaction required)
→ Sensory-safe sound (no sudden changes, predictable audio)
→ Zero-demand interface (just press play)
→ Frequency-based sounds that work with the nervous system directly

We've reviewed every major calming app through a neurodivergent lens. Not which apps have the best production values. Which apps actually work for children whose brains process sound differently.

The pattern is undeniable: every mainstream app was designed for neurotypical children. Only one platform was built from the ground up for neurodivergent children. HushAway's design decisions all stem from starting with ND children as the primary audience.

If generic apps have failed your child before, that wasn't their failure. It was design mismatch.

The Open Sanctuary offers free ND-first sounds to explore. Not a trial. Not a preview. Permanently free sounds designed for neurodivergent children from day one.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your ND child has rejected every calming app. Here's why."

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"Every mainstream app—Calm, Headspace, Moshi—was built for neurotypical children first. They assume your child can follow instructions during stress. Make choices when overwhelmed. Process guided meditation when dysregulated.

ND children need the opposite. Passive listening. Sensory-safe sound. Zero demands. Just press play.

If generic apps failed your child, that wasn't their failure. It was design mismatch."

**[25-30 seconds: CTA]**
"Try something built for them from the start. The Open Sanctuary. Free, ND-first sounds."

- Visual hierarchy: Bold headlines + supporting text in smaller font
- Consistent design system across all slides
- Minimalist aesthetic (reduces sensory overwhelm, reinforces message)

**Reel visual suggestions:**
- B-roll: Parent holding phone at night (2am search), child with headphones looking frustrated, phone screen showing app interfaces
- Text overlays: Key phrases ("Built for neurotypical children", "Adapted for ND children later", "Design mismatch")
- Transitions: Gentle fades (not jarring cuts—practice what you preach about sensory-safe design)
- End frame: The Open Sanctuary logo + "Free ND-first sounds" text
