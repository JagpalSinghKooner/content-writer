## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
Most "autism-friendly" apps
weren't designed for
AUTISTIC PROCESSING

[Bold text, high contrast - white text on dark background]

### Slide 2: The Problem
90% of autistic children
experience sensory sensitivities

But most apps include:
• Unpredictable sounds
• Volume changes
• Sudden effects
• Intrusive voices

### Slide 3: What They Need
Predictability
NOT novelty

When your child knows
what's coming next,
their nervous system
can relax

### Slide 4: Passive Listening
The best apps
ask NOTHING
from your child

No choices
No instructions
No engagement required

Just press play

### Slide 5: Why Meditation Apps Fail
Calm, Headspace, Smiling Mind
require:

Following instructions ✗
Visualisation ✗
Active participation ✗

During overwhelm?
Impossible.

### Slide 6: Sensory-Safe Design
Generic apps:
✗ Volume inconsistency
✗ Layered complexity
✗ Unpredictable transitions

Autism-designed apps:
✓ Consistent volume
✓ Careful layering
✓ Smooth transitions

### Slide 7: UK Voices Matter
American apps =
• Unfamiliar accents
• US cultural references
• Added cognitive load

For UK autistic children,
familiar voices help

### Slide 8: The Difference
Apps ADAPTED for autism:
Start with neurotypical design

Apps DESIGNED for autism:
Start with autistic processing

One retrofits.
One respects.

### Slide 9: What to Look For
✓ Passive listening
✓ Sensory-safe audio
✓ Predictable content
✓ UK-based
✓ Designed, not adapted

### Slide 10: CTA

## Caption

If your autistic child doesn't respond to calming apps, it's not them. It's the apps.

.
.
.

Most "autism-friendly" apps weren't designed for autistic processing. They were designed for neurotypical children and marketed to autism families later.

The difference? Everything.

Research shows 90% of autistic children experience sensory sensitivities. But most apps include unpredictable volume changes, layered audio complexity, sudden sound effects. A voice that seems gentle to neurotypical ears might feel intrusive to your child.

And meditation apps? They require following instructions, visualisation, active engagement. During meltdowns, autistic children often cannot provide these things. The app becomes another demand on an already overloaded system.

What autistic children actually need:
• Predictability (no surprises)
• Passive listening (no instructions)
• Sensory-safe audio (consistent, smooth)
• UK voices (familiar accents help)

Apps designed specifically for autism from the ground up work differently. Press play, that's it. No choices. No engagement required. Just sound that respects how autistic brains work.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Why don't calming apps work for your autistic child?"

[Visual: Parent looking exhausted, scrolling through apps on phone]

**[3-25 seconds: VALUE]**
"Here's the truth most parents don't know:

Most 'autism-friendly' apps weren't designed for autistic processing.

They were designed for neurotypical children and adapted later.

The difference?

Autistic children need:
• Predictable sounds (no surprises)
• Passive listening (no instructions)
• Sensory-safe audio (no sudden changes)

But most apps require engagement, choices, following instructions.

During meltdowns? Impossible."
