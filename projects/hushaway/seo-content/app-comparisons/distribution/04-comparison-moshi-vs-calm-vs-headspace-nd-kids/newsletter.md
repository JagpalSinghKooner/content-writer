# Newsletter Snippet: Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace for ND Kids

## Hook

If you've downloaded Moshi, Calm, and Headspace for your neurodivergent child, you've probably noticed something frustrating. They don't work the way the reviews promised. That's not your child's fault. It's not yours either.

## Body

The Big 3 calming apps were all designed for neurotypical children. Some adapted for neurodivergent needs. Some didn't. None were built from scratch with ND children as the starting point.

During overwhelm, your ND child can't follow instructions, make decisions, tolerate unpredictability, or engage with interactive elements. Yet Calm requires guided meditation. Headspace teaches mindfulness as a practice. Even Moshi (the best of the three) has variable sensory safety.

There's a difference between "adapted FOR" and "designed FOR." Adapted means you build for one audience and modify for another. Designed means you start with your child's brain and build specifically for how it works.

We compared all three through a neurodivergent lens. Moshi scores 6/10 (passive listening, but not ND-first). Calm scores 3/10 (wrong approach for overwhelm). Headspace scores 2/10 (teaching model, not immediate support).

The fourth option is HushAway®. Passive listening from day one. Sensory-safe by design. Zero demands. Frequency-based sounds that work with the nervous system directly.

## Alternative: Teaser Format

**This week:** We tested every calming app on the market

What we found:
• Moshi comes closest but wasn't built for ND children
• Calm requires instruction-following (exactly what ND kids can't do during overwhelm)
• Headspace teaches meditation as long-term practice (not crisis support)
• All three started with neurotypical children and adapted (or didn't) later

The full comparison includes ND suitability scores, what works, what fails, and the fourth option you probably didn't know existed.
