# Instagram Content: Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace for ND Kids

## Carousel

### Slide 1: Cover
Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace:
Which Actually Works
for ND Kids?

(The answer might surprise you)

### Slide 2: The Question
Five stars.
Thousands of glowing reviews.

So why won't it work
for YOUR child?

### Slide 3: The Truth
They were all built for
neurotypical children.

Every. Single. One.

### Slide 4: What ND Children Need
During overwhelm, your child can't:

→ Follow instructions
→ Make decisions
→ Tolerate surprises
→ Interact with screens

### Slide 5: Moshi
ND Score: 6/10

✓ Passive listening
✓ UK voices
✓ Story-driven

✗ Variable sensory safety
✗ Not built for ND

### Slide 6: Calm
ND Score: 3/10

✓ Beautiful production

✗ Requires instruction-following
✗ Interactive engagement
✗ American voices

### Slide 7: Headspace
ND Score: 2/10

✓ Clinical credibility

✗ Teaching model
✗ Requires practice
✗ Highest price

### Slide 8: The Pattern
All three:
✗ Built for neurotypical first
✗ Adapted (or didn't) later
✗ None designed FOR ND children

### Slide 9: The Fourth Option
What if we started WITH
neurodivergent children?

• Passive listening (zero demands)
• Sensory-safe by design
• Frequency-based sounds
• UK voices

That's HushAway®

## Caption

We tested every calming app for neurodivergent children. Here's what the five-star reviews won't tell you.

.
.
.

Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace. Parents download all three at some point. Usually during a brutal bedtime week. Usually after a well-meaning friend suggests one of them.

And then nothing. Or worse than nothing.

Here's why: they were all built for neurotypical children first. Moshi comes closest (passive listening, UK voices). But even Moshi wasn't designed FOR neurodivergent children. It was designed for all children, and some ND kids benefit through luck.

Calm requires instruction-following. Headspace teaches meditation as a practice. Both assume your child can engage when they're overwhelmed. That's exactly when executive function goes offline.

During the 9pm meltdown when you actually need support, guided meditation doesn't help. Interactive choices add stress. Unpredictable audio triggers rather than soothes.

We built HushAway® because we needed it ourselves. Nothing was designed for our children. So we created something that was. Passive listening from day one. Sensory-safe by design. Zero demands. Frequency-based sounds that work with the nervous system directly.

"Adapted FOR" vs "designed FOR" isn't semantics. It's the difference between hoping something might work and knowing it was built for your child's brain.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

## Reel Script (30 seconds)

**[0-3 seconds: HOOK]**
"Your child's calming app probably isn't working. And it's not your fault."

**[3-22 seconds: VALUE]**
"Moshi, Calm, Headspace. I tested all three with my neurodivergent clients.

Here's the pattern nobody mentions: they were all built for neurotypical children first. Some adapted for ND needs. Some didn't. None started with neurodivergent children.

During overwhelm, your ND child can't follow instructions, make decisions, or tolerate surprises. Yet these apps require exactly that.

We built HushAway differently. Passive listening. Sensory-safe. Zero demands. Built FOR ND children from day one."
