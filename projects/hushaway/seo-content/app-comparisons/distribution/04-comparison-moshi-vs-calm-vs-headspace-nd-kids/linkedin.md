### Slide 1: Hook
Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace:
Which Actually Works for ND Kids?

(Plus the fourth option nobody mentions)

Swipe → for the honest review

### Slide 2: The Problem
Five stars. Thousands of glowing reviews.

So why won't it work for YOUR child?

Because they were all built for neurotypical children.

### Slide 3: What ND Children Need
During overwhelm, your child can't:
• Follow instructions
• Make decisions
• Tolerate unpredictability
• Engage with interactive elements

That moment is when they need support most.

### Slide 4: Moshi Review
✓ Passive listening (mostly)
✓ UK voices and context
✓ Story-driven, not instruction-driven

✗ Not designed for ND children
✗ Variable sensory safety
✗ Age ceiling around 10-11

ND suitability: 6/10

### Slide 5: Calm Review
✓ High production quality
✓ Celebrity narrators
✓ Wide content library

✗ Requires instruction-following
✗ Interactive engagement needed
✗ American voices and context

ND suitability: 3/10

### Slide 6: Headspace Review
✓ Age-banded content
✓ Structured progression
✓ Clinical credibility

✗ Teaching model (not immediate)
✗ Requires consistent practice
✗ Highest price, poorest fit

ND suitability: 2/10

### Slide 7: The Pattern
All three started with neurotypical children.

They adapted FOR neurodivergent needs.

None were designed FOR ND children from the start.

That distinction matters.

### Slide 8: The Fourth Option
What if an app was built specifically for how ND brains work?

• Passive listening (zero demands)
• Sensory-safe by design
• Frequency-based sounds
• UK voices and context

That's HushAway®.

### Slide 9: Quick Comparison
| Feature | Big 3 | HushAway® |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Built for ND | No | Yes |
| Passive | No | Always |
| Free tier | Limited | Yes |
| Works during meltdowns | Rarely | Yes |

### Slide 10: CTA
Tried the Big 3 and they didn't work?

## Text Post 1

I've tested every calming app on the market with my neurodivergent clients.

Here's what nobody tells you about Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace.

They were all built for neurotypical children first. Every single one.

Moshi comes closest to working for ND kids. Passive listening, UK voices, story-driven content. But even Moshi wasn't designed FOR neurodivergent children. It was designed for all children and some ND kids benefit by luck.

Calm requires instruction-following. During dysregulation, that's exactly what ND children can't do. "Breathe in for four counts" assumes executive function that's already offline.

Headspace teaches meditation as a long-term skill. Beautiful theory. But when your autistic child is in meltdown recovery at 9pm, "give it two weeks" doesn't help.

The pattern: all three started somewhere else and tried to stretch to reach ND children.

What if we started WITH neurodivergent children instead?

That's why we built HushAway®. Passive listening from day one. Sensory-safe by design. Zero demands. Frequency-based sounds that work with the nervous system directly.

"Adapted FOR" vs "designed FOR" isn't just semantics. It's the difference between hoping something might work and knowing it was built for your child.

One quiet moment can change a whole day for a child.

Your child's calming app probably isn't working.

Not because your child is difficult.

Because the app was designed for easier children and marketed to yours.

I compared Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace through a neurodivergent lens. Here's what matters:

During the moments your ND child needs support most, they can't:
→ Follow instructions
→ Make decisions
→ Tolerate unpredictability
→ Engage with interactive elements

Calm's guided meditation? Requires all four.
Headspace's mindfulness training? Same problem.
Even Moshi (the best of the three) has variable sensory safety.

The reviews won't tell you this because they're written by parents of neurotypical children.

Five stars means nothing if the app fails during the 9pm meltdown when you actually need it to work.

We built HushAway® because we were exhausted parents who'd tried everything. Nothing was designed for our children. So we created something that was.

Passive listening. Sensory-safe. Zero demands. Frequency-based sounds.

It's what happens when you start with ND children instead of adapting from neurotypical ones.

Explore The Open Sanctuary when you're ready.
