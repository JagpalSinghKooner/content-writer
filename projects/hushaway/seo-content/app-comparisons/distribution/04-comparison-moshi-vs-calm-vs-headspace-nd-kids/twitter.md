# Twitter/X Content: Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace for ND Kids

## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace: which works for neurodivergent kids?

I tested all three with ND clients.

Here's what the five-star reviews won't tell you.

🧵 Thread:

### Tweet 2
The pattern nobody mentions:

All three were built for neurotypical children first.

Moshi, Calm, Headspace. Every single one.

Some adapted for ND needs. Some didn't bother.

None started WITH neurodivergent children.

### Tweet 3
What ND children need during overwhelm:

• No instructions to follow
• No decisions to make
• Zero unpredictability
• No interactive demands

Now compare that to what these apps require.

See the problem?

### Tweet 4
Moshi (best of the three):

✓ Passive listening
✓ UK voices
✓ Story-driven

✗ Variable sensory safety
✗ Not designed for ND
✗ Age ceiling around 10

ND score: 6/10

Better than most. Still not built for ND brains.

### Tweet 5
Calm:

✓ Beautiful production
✓ Celebrity narrators

✗ Requires instruction-following
✗ Interactive engagement
✗ American voices

ND score: 3/10

Works great for neurotypical kids. Fails for ND overwhelm.

### Tweet 6
Headspace:

✓ Clinical credibility
✓ Structured progression

✗ Teaching model (not immediate help)
✗ Requires consistent practice
✗ Highest price, poorest ND fit

ND score: 2/10

Meditation is lovely. But not at 9pm during a meltdown.

### Tweet 7
The real issue:

"Adapted FOR" ≠ "designed FOR"

Adapted = built for one audience, modified for another

Designed = built from scratch for your child's brain

That difference matters more than you'd think.

### Tweet 8
We built HushAway® because we needed it ourselves.

Passive listening. Sensory-safe. Zero demands. Frequency-based sounds.

It's what happens when you start with ND children instead of stretching from neurotypical ones.

### Tweet 9 (Wrap)
TL;DR:

• Moshi: Best of Big 3, still not ND-first
• Calm: Wrong approach for ND overwhelm
• Headspace: Teaching tool, not crisis support
• HushAway: Built FOR ND children from day one

Tried the Big 3 and they didn't work?

## Single Tweets

### Tweet A (Hot Take)
Hot take:

Five-star reviews on calming apps mean nothing if your child is neurodivergent.

Those reviews were written by parents of neurotypical children.

Your child isn't difficult. The apps were designed for easier children.

### Tweet B (Comparison)
Moshi vs Calm vs Headspace for ND kids:

Moshi: 6/10 (best of three, not ND-first)
Calm: 3/10 (requires instruction-following)
Headspace: 2/10 (teaching model, not immediate)

None were built FOR neurodivergent children.

All were adapted from neurotypical design.

### Tweet C (Insight)
During an autistic meltdown, your child can't:
• Follow instructions
• Make decisions
• Tolerate surprises
• Interact with screens

Now tell me how guided meditation is supposed to help.

This is why "adapted for" ≠ "designed for."

### Tweet D (Problem/Solution)
Your ND child's calming app probably fails because:

✗ Requires instruction-following
✗ Asks for decisions
✗ Has unpredictable audio
✗ Demands interaction

What works instead:

✓ Passive listening
✓ Sensory-safe sounds
✓ Zero demands
✓ Frequency-based

### Tweet E (Context)
"Just use Calm or Headspace"

Said by every well-meaning friend who doesn't understand that:

1. Those apps require cognitive engagement
2. ND overwhelm = executive function offline
3. Guided meditation assumes regulation to learn regulation
4. That's a paradox

We needed something different.
