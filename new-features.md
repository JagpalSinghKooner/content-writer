## Feature 1: Add Marketing History to Client Profile

**Objective:** Capture what marketing the client has tried before.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `.claude/skills/onboard-client/profile-template.md` has new "Marketing History" section with tables for: What You've Tried, What Worked, What Failed, Current Active Marketing
- [ ] `.claude/skills/onboard-client/SKILL.md` has new "Section 10: Marketing History" interview questions

**Starter Prompt:**
> Add Marketing History to client profile. In `.claude/skills/onboard-client/profile-template.md`, add new "Marketing History" section after "Goals" with: "What You've Tried" table (Channel/Tactic, Timeframe, Results, Why Stopped/Continued); "What Worked" list (tactic — why it worked); "What Failed" list (tactic — why it failed); "Current Active Marketing" table (Channel, Frequency, Performance). In `.claude/skills/onboard-client/SKILL.md`, add interview section asking: What marketing channels have you tried (SEO, paid ads, social, email)? What worked and what didn't? Why did you stop or continue each? What's currently active and what results are you seeing?

**Status:** backlog

**Notes:** Moved from TASKS.md Task 3.1. Implement when client feedback suggests this context would improve content quality.
