---

### 4. AI Patterns

Structural tells that reveal AI authorship.

**Repetitive Sentence Starts:**
- ✗ 3+ consecutive sentences starting with the same word
- ✗ Every paragraph starting with "The" or "This"
- ✓ Vary your sentence openers

**The Rule of Threes:**
- ✗ Everything in perfect threes (3 points, 3 examples, 3 benefits)
- ✗ "First... Second... Third..." structure
- ✓ Use 2, 4, or 5 points sometimes

**Hedging Overload:**
- ✗ Excessive use of: might, could, perhaps, possibly, potentially, may
- ✗ "This could potentially help you might possibly..."
- ✓ Make definitive statements when appropriate

**Empty Transitions:**
- ✗ "Now let's move on to..."
- ✗ "With that said..."
- ✗ "Having covered X, let's turn to Y"
- ✓ Just start the next section

**Artificial Balance:**
- ✗ Every positive followed by a caveat
- ✗ "While X is great, it's important to consider Y"
- ✓ Take a stance

---

### 4b. No Em Dashes

Em dashes (—) are an AI fingerprint. Human writers rarely use them; AI uses them constantly for parenthetical asides and list introductions.

**The Rule:** Never use em dashes. Restructure the sentence instead.

**Why not just replace with other punctuation?**

Swapping em dashes for commas, colons, or parentheses keeps the AI sentence structure. The goal is to write like a human, which means restructuring entirely.

**Restructuring Examples:**

| AI Pattern (with em dash) | Human Alternative |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "Sleep tracking apps — like Oura and Whoop — can help" | "Sleep tracking apps like Oura and Whoop can help" |
| "The solution — cognitive behavioural therapy — works" | "The solution is cognitive behavioural therapy, and it works" |
| "One thing matters — consistency" | "One thing matters: consistency" OR "Consistency is the only thing that matters" |
| "ADHD affects sleep — but not how you'd expect" | "ADHD affects sleep, but not how you'd expect" OR start a new sentence |
| "The real problem — and this surprises most people — is timing" | "The real problem is timing. This surprises most people." |

**Detection:**
- Search for "—" (em dash character)
- Also check for " - " with spaces (sometimes used as em dash substitute)

### 5. SEO Requirements

Technical requirements for search optimisation.

**Keyword Placement:**
- [ ] Primary keyword in first 150 words
- [ ] Primary keyword in at least one H2
- [ ] Primary keyword density: 1-2% (not stuffed)

**Content Length:**
- [ ] Minimum 1,500 words
- [ ] No maximum, but stay focused

**Meta Data:**
- [ ] Meta title: under 60 characters
- [ ] Meta description: 140-160 characters
- [ ] Both include primary keyword

**Links:**
- [ ] At least 3 internal links
- [ ] External links to authoritative sources where relevant
- [ ] No broken links

**Structure:**
- [ ] One H1 only (the title)
- [ ] H1 contains primary keyword AND a hook (not keyword alone)
- [ ] Logical H2/H3 hierarchy
- [ ] No duplicate heading text (each H1/H2/H3 must be unique)
- [ ] Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)

**H1 Format Examples:**

| Bad (Keyword Only) ✗ | Good (Keyword + Hook) ✓ |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| ADHD Sleep Problems | Why Your ADHD Brain Won't Let You Sleep |
| Email Marketing Guide | Email Marketing Guide: Send Less, Sell More |
| Content Strategy | The Content Strategy That Built a 7-Figure Business |
| SEO Best Practices | SEO Best Practices the Experts Actually Use |

**Why keyword-only H1s fail:**
- Boring (no reason to click)
- Generic (everyone ranks for the same title)
- No differentiation in search results
- Misses the hook that drives engagement

---

### 6. External Citations (E-E-A-T)

Citations build trust and demonstrate expertise. Proper sourcing is a Google ranking factor.

**Citation Format:**

Use this format for all external citations:

> [Author/Organisation], [Year]: [hyperlinked title](URL)

**Examples:**
- Google, 2023: [Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines](https://example.com)
- NHS, 2024: [Mental Health Statistics](https://example.com)
- Dr. Sarah Chen, 2023: [The Future of Remote Work](https://example.com)

**Citation Checklist:**
- [ ] Every citation includes a working hyperlink
- [ ] Author or organisation name is present
- [ ] Publication year is included
- [ ] Link opens in context (not broken or paywalled without note)

**Preferred Sources:**
- Peer-reviewed studies and academic journals
- Government publications (.gov, .gov.uk)
- Official documentation and whitepapers
- Industry reports from recognised bodies
- Primary sources (original research, interviews)
- Established news outlets with editorial standards

**Sources to Avoid:**
- Content farms (eHow, Buzzle, article directories)
- Sources older than 3 years (unless foundational/historical)
- Wikipedia (use it to find primary sources, don't cite it directly)
- Social media posts (unless quoting a verified expert)
- Competitor content
- Sites with excessive ads or poor design
- Sources without clear authorship or dates
- Aggregator sites that don't add original insight

**Minimum Requirements:**
- [ ] At least 2 external citations per 1,500 words
- [ ] Citations support claims, not just decorate content
- [ ] No citation to the same domain more than twice per article

---

## WARN Conditions

Content is **flagged** but not rejected. Fix if possible.

---

### Missing Contractions

Formal writing sounds robotic. Use contractions naturally.

| Stiff ✗ | Natural ✓ |
|---------|-----------|
| it is | it's |
| you are | you're |
| we are | we're |
| do not | don't |
| cannot | can't |
| would not | wouldn't |
| they are | they're |
| that is | that's |

---

### Monotonous Sentence Length

Vary your rhythm.

- ✗ All sentences 15-20 words
- ✓ Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- ✓ Occasional one-word sentences. Like this.

---

### No Personal Voice

Content should feel like a human wrote it.

- ✗ Pure information dump
- ✓ Include opinions ("We've found that...")
- ✓ Share experiences ("In our experience...")
- ✓ Take positions ("The best approach is...")

---

### No Specific Examples

Vague content doesn't convert.

- ✗ "This can save you time"
- ✓ "This saves our clients 4 hours per week on average"
- ✗ "Many businesses struggle with..."
- ✓ "73% of businesses struggle with..."

---

### Passive Voice Overuse

Active voice is stronger.

- ✗ "The report was written by our team"
- ✓ "Our team wrote the report"
- ✗ "Results can be achieved by following..."
- ✓ "Follow these steps to achieve results"

---

## Terminology

Standard definitions for terms used across all skills. Use these consistently.

### Hook

**Definition:** An opening that grabs attention — the first line, first paragraph, headline, or first slide that stops the scroll.

**Where it appears:**
- **Articles:** The opening paragraph or intro section
- **Emails:** The subject line and first sentence
- **Newsletters:** The opening section before the main content
- **Distribution:** The first slide (carousels), first line (text posts), first 3 seconds (video)

**A good hook:**
- Stops the scroll
- Creates curiosity or tension
- Self-selects the right audience
- Promises value without giving everything away

---

### CTA (Call to Action)

**Definition:** What you want the reader to do next — the specific action you're asking them to take.

**Every piece of content should have ONE clear CTA.** Multiple CTAs = no CTAs.

---

### Soft CTA

**Definition:** A low-commitment action that moves the reader closer without requiring much from them.

**Examples:**
- Reply to this email
- Save this for later
- Follow for more
- Share with someone who needs this
- Comment your thoughts
- Drop a 🔥 if this resonated

**When to use:** Early in a relationship (welcome emails, value content), social posts, newsletters. Build engagement before asking for commitment.

---

### Hard CTA

**Definition:** A high-commitment action that requires the reader to invest time, money, or significant effort.

**Examples:**
- Buy now
- Sign up
- Book a call
- Start your trial
- Join the programme
- Get instant access

**When to use:** Conversion emails, sales pages, pitch content, landing pages. Only after trust is established.

---

### CTA Placement by Content Type

| Content Type | Primary CTA Type | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **SEO articles** | Soft (internal links, newsletter signup) | Hard CTAs feel salesy in educational content |
| **Welcome emails** | Soft (reply, engage) | Build relationship first |
| **Nurture emails** | Soft | Continue value delivery |
| **Conversion emails** | Hard | The pitch sequence |
| **Newsletters** | Soft (occasionally hard for offers) | Primarily value-driven |
| **Distribution (social)** | Soft | Engagement over conversion |
| **Landing pages** | Hard | Purpose is conversion |
