---

## WARN Conditions

Content is **flagged** but not rejected. Fix if possible.

---

### Missing Contractions

Formal writing sounds robotic. Use contractions naturally.

---

### Monotonous Sentence Length

Vary your rhythm. Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones.

---

### No Personal Voice

Content should feel like a human wrote it. Include opinions, share experiences, take positions.

---

### No Specific Examples

Vague content doesn't convert. Use specific numbers, percentages, and concrete examples.

---

### Passive Voice Overuse

Active voice is stronger. Prefer active constructions over passive ones.
