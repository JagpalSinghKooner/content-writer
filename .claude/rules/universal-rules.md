### 4. AI Patterns

Structural tells that reveal AI authorship.

**Repetitive Sentence Starts:**
- ✗ 3+ consecutive sentences starting with the same word
- ✗ Every paragraph starting with "The" or "This"
- ✓ Vary your sentence openers

**The Rule of Threes:**
- ✗ Everything in perfect threes (3 points, 3 examples, 3 benefits)
- ✗ "First... Second... Third..." structure
- ✓ Use 2, 4, or 5 points sometimes

**Hedging Overload:**
- ✗ Excessive use of: might, could, perhaps, possibly, potentially, may
- ✗ "This could potentially help you might possibly..."
- ✓ Make definitive statements when appropriate

**Empty Transitions:**
- ✗ "Now let's move on to..."
- ✗ "With that said..."
- ✗ "Having covered X, let's turn to Y"
- ✓ Just start the next section

**Artificial Balance:**
- ✗ Every positive followed by a caveat
- ✗ "While X is great, it's important to consider Y"
- ✓ Take a stance

---

### 4b. No Em Dashes

Em dashes (—) are an AI fingerprint. Human writers rarely use them; AI uses them constantly for parenthetical asides and list introductions.

**The Rule:** Never use em dashes. Restructure the sentence instead.

**Why not just replace with other punctuation?**

Swapping em dashes for commas, colons, or parentheses keeps the AI sentence structure. The goal is to write like a human, which means restructuring entirely.

**Restructuring Examples:**

| AI Pattern (with em dash) | Human Alternative |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "Sleep tracking apps — like Oura and Whoop — can help" | "Sleep tracking apps like Oura and Whoop can help" |
| "The solution — cognitive behavioural therapy — works" | "The solution is cognitive behavioural therapy, and it works" |
| "One thing matters — consistency" | "One thing matters: consistency" OR "Consistency is the only thing that matters" |
| "ADHD affects sleep — but not how you'd expect" | "ADHD affects sleep, but not how you'd expect" OR start a new sentence |
| "The real problem — and this surprises most people — is timing" | "The real problem is timing. This surprises most people." |

**Detection:**
- Search for "—" (em dash character)
- Also check for " - " with spaces (sometimes used as em dash substitute)

### 5. SEO Requirements

Technical requirements for search optimisation.

**Keyword Placement:**
- [ ] Primary keyword in first 150 words
- [ ] Primary keyword in at least one H2
- [ ] Primary keyword density: 1-2% (not stuffed)

**Content Length:**
- [ ] Minimum 1,500 words
- [ ] No maximum, but stay focused

**Meta Data:**
- [ ] Meta title: under 60 characters
- [ ] Meta description: 140-160 characters
- [ ] Both include primary keyword

**Links:**
- [ ] At least 3 internal links
- [ ] External links to authoritative sources where relevant
- [ ] No broken links

**Structure:**
- [ ] One H1 only (the title)
- [ ] H1 contains primary keyword AND a hook (not keyword alone)
- [ ] Logical H2/H3 hierarchy
- [ ] No duplicate heading text (each H1/H2/H3 must be unique)
- [ ] Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)

**H1 Format Examples:**

| Bad (Keyword Only) ✗ | Good (Keyword + Hook) ✓ |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| ADHD Sleep Problems | Why Your ADHD Brain Won't Let You Sleep |
| Email Marketing Guide | Email Marketing Guide: Send Less, Sell More |
| Content Strategy | The Content Strategy That Built a 7-Figure Business |
| SEO Best Practices | SEO Best Practices the Experts Actually Use |

**Why keyword-only H1s fail:**
- Boring (no reason to click)
- Generic (everyone ranks for the same title)
- No differentiation in search results
- Misses the hook that drives engagement

---

### 5a. Internal Link Format

Internal links must use the article's frontmatter `slug` value, not file paths or directory structures.

**Correct Format:** `/{slug}`

The URL should be the exact slug from the target article's frontmatter, with a leading slash. No directories, no file extensions, no number prefixes.

**Examples:**

| Correct | Incorrect | Why Wrong |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `/why-generic-calming-apps-fail-nd-children` | `/app-comparisons/articles/01-why-generic-calming-apps-fail-nd-children` | Uses directory structure |
| `/adhd-bedtime-routine` | `/adhd-sleep/articles/02-adhd-bedtime-routine.md` | Uses file path with extension |
| `/calming-sounds-adhd` | `/01-calming-sounds-adhd` | Includes file number prefix |

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Link URL is `/{slug}` format (single path segment after leading slash)
- [ ] Slug matches target article's frontmatter `slug` field exactly
- [ ] No file extensions (`.md`)
- [ ] No directory structure (`/pillar/articles/...`)
- [ ] No file number prefixes (`/01-...`)

**Why this matters:**

These articles will be uploaded to a CMS where URLs are defined by the slug, not the local file structure. Links using file paths will break in production.

---

### 6. External Citations (E-E-A-T)

Citations build trust and demonstrate expertise. Proper sourcing is a Google ranking factor.

**Citation Format:**

Use this format for all external citations:

> [Author/Organisation], [Year]: [hyperlinked title](URL)

**Examples:**
- Google, 2023: [Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines](https://example.com)
- NHS, 2024: [Mental Health Statistics](https://example.com)
- Dr. Sarah Chen, 2023: [The Future of Remote Work](https://example.com)

**Citation Checklist:**
- [ ] Every citation includes a working hyperlink
- [ ] Author or organisation name is present
- [ ] Publication year is included
- [ ] Link opens in context (not broken or paywalled without note)

**Minimum Requirements:**
- [ ] At least 2 external citations per 1,500 words
- [ ] Citations support claims, not just decorate content
- [ ] No citation to the same domain more than twice per article

---

## WARN Conditions

Content is **flagged** but not rejected. Fix if possible.

---

### Missing Contractions

Formal writing sounds robotic. Use contractions naturally.

---

### Monotonous Sentence Length

Vary your rhythm. Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones.

---

### No Personal Voice

Content should feel like a human wrote it. Include opinions, share experiences, take positions.

---

### No Specific Examples

Vague content doesn't convert. Use specific numbers, percentages, and concrete examples.

---

### Passive Voice Overuse

Active voice is stronger. Prefer active constructions over passive ones.
