## Rule 4b: No Em Dashes

Em dashes (—) are an AI fingerprint. Human writers rarely use them; AI uses them constantly for parenthetical asides and list introductions.

**The Rule:** Never use em dashes. Restructure the sentence instead.

**Why not just replace with other punctuation?**

Swapping em dashes for commas, colons, or parentheses keeps the AI sentence structure. The goal is to write like a human, which means restructuring entirely.

**Restructuring Examples:**

- "Sleep tracking apps — like Oura and Whoop — can help" -> "Sleep tracking apps like Oura and Whoop can help"
- "The solution — cognitive behavioural therapy — works" -> "The solution is cognitive behavioural therapy, and it works"
- "One thing matters — consistency" -> "One thing matters: consistency" or "Consistency is the only thing that matters"
- "ADHD affects sleep — but not how you'd expect" -> "ADHD affects sleep, but not how you'd expect" or start a new sentence
- "The real problem — and this surprises most people — is timing" -> "The real problem is timing. This surprises most people."

**Detection:**
- Search for the em dash character (U+2014)
- Also check for " - " with spaces (sometimes used as em dash substitute)
