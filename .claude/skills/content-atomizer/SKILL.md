# Content Atomizer Skill

## The Core Job

Transform source content into **platform-native assets** that:
- Match each platform's algorithm signals
- Use format-specific best practices
- Include hooks proven to stop the scroll
- Feel native, not repurposed

---

## Input Types

### What Can Be Atomized

- **Blog Post** → All platforms (High)
- **Newsletter** → LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram (High)
- **Podcast Episode** → Short-form video, threads, carousels (Very High)
- **Long-form Video** → Shorts, Reels, TikToks, carousels (Very High)
- **Webinar/Talk** → All platforms (Very High)
- **Case Study** → LinkedIn, Twitter threads (High)
- **Data/Research** → Carousels, threads, single posts (Medium-High)
- **Framework/Process** → Carousels, threads, video scripts (High)

### What to Extract

From any source, identify:

1. **The Core Insight** — The one thing someone should remember
2. **Supporting Points** — 3-7 sub-points that build the argument
3. **Stories/Examples** — Concrete illustrations
4. **Data Points** — Stats, numbers, proof
5. **Contrarian Takes** — Opinions that challenge conventional wisdom
6. **Actionable Steps** — What someone can do with this
7. **Quotable Lines** — Punchy phrases that stand alone

## Platform Playbooks

### LinkedIn

**Algorithm Signals (December 2025):**
- **Dwell time** — How long people spend reading (still #1)
- **Topic authority** — Consistent niche posting builds algorithmic trust
- **Golden hour** — First 60 minutes determines reach to 2nd/3rd-degree connections
- **Relevance over recency** — Mid-2025 update shows older posts (2-3 weeks) if highly relevant
- **Authentic engagement** — AI detects engagement pods via comment velocity and patterns
- **Native content** — Posts without links get significantly more reach

**2025 Reality Check:** Organic views down ~50%, engagement down ~25% as LinkedIn prioritizes quality over quantity. Post 2-3x/week max, not daily.

**Optimal Specs:**

- **Carousel:** 5-10 slides, 1080x1350px. Highest dwell time, save-worthy
- **Text Post:** 1,200-1,500 chars, 3-line hook. Depth over frequency
- **Document:** PDF, 10-15 pages max. Good for frameworks
- **Video:** 30-90 seconds, captions required. Lower reach than text/carousels

- **Time spent** — On tweet and clicked links
- **Profile clicks** — Curiosity driven by tweet
- **Media boost** — Images/videos/GIFs increase visibility scores
- **Early engagement** — First hours critical for amplification

**2025 Changes:** Following feed now uses **Grok AI** for ranking (based on past interactions and topics)—no longer purely chronological. Users default to For You feed.

**Optimal Specs:**

### Instagram

**Algorithm Signals (December 2025):**
- **DM shares ("sends per reach")** — Now one of the STRONGEST discovery signals
- **Saves** — Still critical for Feed and Explore
- **Watch time & retention** — For Reels, completion rate is king
- **Likes per reach** — Quality signal (not raw likes)
- **Early velocity** — First 30-90 minutes determines push to wider audience
- **Relationship signals** — DMs, profile taps, comment history with account

**2025 Changes:** Photos getting more support in Feed again (Adam Mosseri). Carousels expanded to 20 slides in some regions. Hashtag weighting significantly reduced. New "Your Algorithm" feature lets users see why they're seeing content.

**Optimal Specs:**

- **Carousel:** 6-10 slides (up to 20), 1080x1350px. Highest engagement, save-worthy
- **Reel:** 7-15 sec (viral), 30-45 sec (tutorials). Best for discovery/reach

### TikTok

**Algorithm Signals (December 2025):**
- **Watch time (first seconds)** — Completion rate still #1, but early seconds weighted heavily
- **Rewatch rate** — Multiple views = strong signal
- **Shares** — Especially to DMs
- **Niche community alignment** — 2025 favors specialized audiences over broad virality
- **Contextual categorization** — AI distinguishes humor, education, emotion to match interests
- **Video quality** — Lighting, sound, editing now integrated into ranking

**2025 Changes:** Algorithm now favors **longer content (30-60+ seconds) if retention is high**. Niche communities (#BookTok, etc.) get boosted over generic viral attempts. Deeper AI personalization analyzes watch duration, replays, and cross-platform habits.

**Optimal Specs:**

- **Short-form:** 15-30 seconds. Highest completion rate
- **Medium:** 30-60 seconds. Now favoured if retention is strong
- **Long-form:** 1-3 minutes. Good for depth with engaged audiences
- **Vertical:** 1080x1920px (9:16). Required

#### TikTok Script Template (15-30 seconds)

```
[HOOK - 0-3 seconds]
"[Visual hook + verbal hook simultaneously]"

Options:
- "Stop scrolling if you [identifier]"
- "POV: You just realized [insight]"
- "The [industry] secret no one tells you:"
- "[Controversial statement]—let me explain"
- "I'm about to save you [time/money/pain]"

[BODY - 3-25 seconds]
"Here's the thing:

[Point 1 - delivered fast]

[Point 2 - keep momentum]

[Point 3 - the payoff]"

[CTA - 25-30 seconds]
"Follow for more [topic]"
OR
"Part 2?" [to boost comments]
OR
"Save this" [drives saves]
```

#### TikTok Hook Formulas

**Pattern 1: Pattern Interrupt**
> "[Unexpected visual or statement that breaks scroll pattern]"

**Pattern 2: Identity Call-Out**
> "This is for my [specific group] who [specific situation]"

**Pattern 3: Proof First**
> "[Show the result immediately, then explain how]"

**Pattern 4: Controversy Spark**
> "I'm going to get hate for this but [take]"

**Pattern 5: Curiosity Gap**
> "I can't believe [industry/brand] doesn't want you to know this"

**Pattern 6: Tutorial Promise**
> "In 30 seconds I'll show you how to [specific outcome]"

#### TikTok Content Patterns That Work

1. **Before/After** — Show transformation immediately
2. **Green Screen** — You + content behind you (tweets, articles, data)
3. **Stitch/Duet** — React to trending content in your niche
4. **Day in the Life** — Niche-specific (day in the life of a marketer, etc.)
5. **POV** — "POV: You're [scenario]" with relatable insight
6. **Listicle** — "3 things [outcome]" with fast delivery
7. **Myth Busting** — "Stop believing [common misconception]"

---

### YouTube

**Algorithm Signals (December 2025):**
- **Click-through rate (CTR)** — How often people click when shown your video
- **Average view duration & % watched** — Raw watch time AND completion percentage
- **Session impact** — Does your video keep people on YouTube longer?
- **Viewer satisfaction** — YouTube now uses surveys + behavior to estimate quality
- **Negative feedback** — "Not interested," skips, very low retention hurt you
- **Topical authority** — Channels focused on clear topics get recommended more

**2025 Changes:** AI-driven hyper-personalization (device, time of day, habits). Older evergreen videos get revived when topics trend again. Stronger emphasis on authority, depth, and "entity-rich" content (aligned with Google Search updates).

**Optimal Specs:**

- **Shorts:** 10-35 sec (discovery), up to 60 sec. Highest reach, lower depth
- **Long-form:** 8-12 minutes (sweet spot). Best for monetisation + depth
- **Thumbnail:** 1280x720px. CTR target: 4-10% (Home), 6-12% strong

#### YouTube Shorts Script Template

```
[HOOK - 0-2 seconds]
"[Immediate value promise or pattern interrupt]"

Examples:
- "Here's why [common belief] is wrong"
- "[Number] second [topic] lesson"
- "The [industry] hack that changed everything"

[BODY - 2-50 seconds]
[Deliver value fast]

[Each point: 5-10 seconds max]

[Keep visual movement—don't stand still]

[CTA - 50-60 seconds]
"Subscribe for more [topic]"
OR
"Full video on my channel"
OR
End abruptly (drives rewatch for missed content)
```

#### YouTube Long-Form Framework (HIVES)

**H - Hook (0-30 seconds)**
```
[Pattern interrupt or bold claim]
[Quick credibility if needed]
[Preview of what they'll learn]
"By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to [outcome]"
```

**I - Intro (30 seconds - 1 minute)**
```
[Brief context on why this matters]
[Who this is for]
[What you'll cover]
"Let's dive in"
```

**V - Value (Main content)**
```
[Deliver on the promise]
[Clear sections with verbal signposting]
"First... Second... Third..."
[Examples and proof for each point]
```

**E - Engagement Prompts (Throughout)**
```
[Every 2-3 minutes, insert:]
"Let me know in the comments if [question]"
"Hit like if [relatable statement]"
"If you're finding this useful, subscribe"
```

**S - Strong CTA (Final 30 seconds)**
```
[Summarize key points]
[Clear next action]
"If you want to go deeper on [topic], watch this video next"
[End screen with subscribe + related video]
```

#### YouTube Thumbnail + Title Patterns

**Thumbnail Principles:**
- 3 elements max (face, text, object)
- High contrast colors
- Readable at small size
- Emotion on face (if showing face)
- Curiosity gap (show outcome, not process)

**Title Formulas:**

- **How I [result]** — "How I Built a 6-Figure Newsletter in 8 Months"

## The Atomization Workflow

### Step 1: Extract

From your source content, pull out:

```
CORE INSIGHT:
[One sentence that captures the main point]

SUPPORTING POINTS:
1. [Point + brief explanation]
2. [Point + brief explanation]
3. [Point + brief explanation]
4. [Point + brief explanation]
5. [Point + brief explanation]

STORIES/EXAMPLES:
- [Story 1]
- [Story 2]

DATA/PROOF:
- [Stat 1]
- [Stat 2]

QUOTABLE LINES:
- "[Quote 1]"
- "[Quote 2]"

CONTRARIAN TAKES:
- [Take 1]
- [Take 2]
```

### Step 2: Map to Platforms

- **Core insight** → All platforms → Single posts, hooks
- **Supporting points (together)** → LinkedIn, Twitter → Carousel, thread
- **Individual points** → All platforms → Single posts
- **Stories** → Instagram, TikTok → Reels, Stories
- **Data points** → LinkedIn, Twitter → Image posts, carousels
- **Quotable lines** → Twitter, Instagram → Quote graphics
- **Contrarian takes** → Twitter, TikTok → Single tweets, video hooks

### Step 3: Transform

For each platform, apply:

1. **Format** — Use the templates above
2. **Hook** — Platform-specific hook formula
3. **Length** — Match platform norms
4. **CTA** — Platform-appropriate action
5. **Voice** — Adjust formality (LinkedIn > Instagram > TikTok)

### Step 4: Sequence

**Optimal posting sequence:**

1. **LinkedIn carousel** — Day 1 (longest shelf life)
2. **Twitter thread** — Day 1-2 (good for discussion)
3. **Instagram carousel** — Day 2-3 (repurpose LinkedIn design)
4. **TikTok/Reel** — Day 3-4 (needs video production)
5. **YouTube Short** — Day 4-5 (can repurpose TikTok)
6. **Single posts** — Ongoing (extract individual points)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **No cross-posting** — Adapt per platform; copy-paste performs 40-60% worse
- **Different hooks per platform** — LinkedIn hooks ≠ TikTok hooks; adjust energy and format
- **Use native features** — Captions on video, visual-first on Instagram, no hashtags on LinkedIn carousels
- **Stagger posting** — Spread across days/weeks so each piece gets room to perform
- **Always include a CTA** — Platform-appropriate next action on every piece

---

## Platform Voice Adjustments

The same insight needs different energy per platform:

- **LinkedIn** — Professional, thoughtful: "After 10 years in marketing, I've learned that simplicity beats complexity. Here's why:"
- **Twitter** — Punchy, direct: "Hot take: Simple marketing > 'sophisticated' marketing. Every time."
- **Instagram** — Visual, inspirational: [Image with text: "Simple > Sophisticated" + story in caption]
- **TikTok** — Casual, energetic: "Y'all I need to talk about why everyone's overcomplicating their marketing..."
- **YouTube** — Conversational, thorough: "If you've been in marketing for any length of time, you've probably noticed something..."

---

## Quick Reference: Platform Specs (December 2025)

- **LinkedIn:** 1,200-1,500 chars, carousel, hook in first 3 lines, top signal: dwell time + topic authority
- **Twitter/X:** <100 chars (single), thread (8-15), hook in first tweet, top signal: replies + early engagement
- **Instagram:** 6-10 slides, carousel, hook on first slide, top signal: DM shares ("sends per reach")
- **TikTok:** 30-60 sec (if retention high), short video, hook in first 3 seconds, top signal: completion + niche alignment
- **YouTube Shorts:** 10-35 sec, vertical video, hook in first 2 seconds, top signal: completion rate
- **YouTube Long:** 8-12 min, horizontal, hook in first 30 seconds, top signal: satisfaction + session time

---

## The Test

Good atomization means:

1. **Each piece stands alone** — Makes sense without the source
2. **Each piece feels native** — Doesn't feel "repurposed"
3. **Hooks match the platform** — Right energy, right format
4. **Value is front-loaded** — Best stuff first
5. **CTAs are appropriate** — Platform-native actions
6. **Quality over quantity** — 5 great pieces > 15 mediocre ones

---

## Output Structure

Save atomized content to the distribution folder within the pillar:

```
{pillar}/distribution/{article-slug}/
├── linkedin.md      # LinkedIn carousel + text posts
├── twitter.md       # Twitter/X thread + single tweets
├── newsletter.md    # Newsletter snippet
└── instagram.md     # Instagram carousel + Reel script
```

**File naming:**
- Use the article slug from the source content
- Each platform file contains all content for that platform
- Include platform-specific formatting and specs in each file

**Example:**
If atomizing `articles/01-what-is-seo.md`, output goes to:
- `distribution/what-is-seo/linkedin.md`
- `distribution/what-is-seo/twitter.md`
- `distribution/what-is-seo/newsletter.md`
- `distribution/what-is-seo/instagram.md`

**Template Reference:** For detailed specifications, see `templates/distribution-template.md`.

---

## Platform File Format Templates

See `templates/distribution-template.md` for complete file format templates (linkedin.md, twitter.md, newsletter.md, instagram.md) with YAML frontmatter and structured sections.

---

## How This Connects to Other Skills

**Input from:**
- **seo-content** → Blog posts to atomize (from `articles/{nn}-{slug}.md`)
- **newsletter** → Newsletter editions to atomize
- **direct-response-copy** → Landing page insights to distribute
- **brand-voice** → Ensures consistent voice across platforms

**The flow:**
1. Create source content (blog, newsletter, video)
2. **content-atomizer transforms into platform pieces**
3. Output saved to `distribution/{slug}/` folder
4. Each piece drives back to source or offer
5. Repeat with next piece of source content
