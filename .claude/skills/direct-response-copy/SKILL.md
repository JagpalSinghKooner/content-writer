# Direct Response Copy

Your job is to write copy that sounds like a smart friend explaining something while deploying persuasion principles the reader doesn't notice.

For extended frameworks, headline formulas, and examples, see `../../references/copywriting-frameworks.md`.

---

## Headlines

The headline does 80% of the work. One headline can outpull another by 19.5x. Same product, same offer, different headline.

### The master formula

> **[Action verb] + [specific outcome] + [timeframe or contrast]**

- "Ship your startup in days, not weeks"
- "Save 4 hours per person every single week"
- "Build a $10K/month business in 90 days"

The contrast version ("days, not weeks") creates before/after in six words.

### The story headline

John Caples wrote the most famous ad headline ever:

> "They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano... But When I Started to Play!"

It's a complete story in 15 words. Embarrassment, then triumph. Universal emotion. You have to know what happened next.

**The pattern:** "They [doubted] when I [action]... But when I [result]..."

### The specificity headline

Ogilvy's Rolls-Royce:

> "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock."

Doesn't say "quiet car." Shows you with specific detail. The reader concludes "this must be quiet" themselves. Self-persuasion is stronger than being told.

**The pattern:** [Specific number/metric] + [Unexpected comparison or detail]

### The question headline

> "Do You Make These Mistakes in English?"

This ran for 40 years. Works because the reader immediately thinks "what mistakes?" and self-selects.

**The pattern:** "Do you [common struggle]?" or "What if you could [desirable outcome]?"

### The transformation headline

> "From Broke Musician to $100K/Year Music Teacher"

Before and after in one line. The reader sees themselves in the "before."

**The pattern:** "From [bad state] to [good state]"

### What makes headlines fail

- Trying to be clever instead of clear
- Forgetting self-interest (what's in it for them?)
- Vague claims instead of specific benefits
- No curiosity gap (tells everything, nothing left to discover)

---

## Opening lines

The first sentence has one job: get them to read the second sentence.

### The direct challenge

> "You've been using Claude wrong."

Stops the scroll. Creates tension. Self-selects readers who suspect you might be right.

### The story opening

> "Last Tuesday, I opened my laptop and saw a number I couldn't believe: $47,329 in one day."

The reader is IN the scene before they know they're reading sales copy.

### The confession

> "I'll be honest with you. I almost gave up on this business three times."

Vulnerability disarms skepticism. They think "they're like me."

### The specific result

> "In 9 months, we did $400k+ on a vibe-coded website using these exact methods."

Specific numbers create credibility. Reader wants to know how.

### The question

> "Have you ever stared at a blank page, knowing you need to write something that sells... and just froze?"

If the question matches their reality, they're hooked.

### The short sentence (Sugarman's approach)

> "It's simple."

> "Here's the truth."

> "This works."

No friction to start reading. They're into paragraph two before they realize it.

### Openings to avoid

- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Are you ready to take your business to the next level?"
- "Welcome! I'm so glad you're here."
- "In this article, you'll learn..."
- "Let's dive in!"

These are generic. They could be about anything. They don't demonstrate understanding.

---

## Curiosity gaps and open loops

The human brain craves closure. Open a loop, and they'll keep reading to close it.

### What's an open loop?

Incomplete information that creates psychological tension. You tease something without revealing it.

TV shows end every episode with a cliffhanger. You can't NOT watch the next one. Same principle in copy.

### Creating the gap

**Weak (no gap):** "10 Tips for Better Writing"

**Strong (gap):** "I tested 47 headlines. One pattern beat everything else by 3x."

The weak version tells you exactly what you'll get. The strong version creates a question: which pattern?

### Seeds of curiosity

End paragraphs with hooks that pull into the next section:

- "But that's not even the best part."
- "Here's where it gets interesting."
- "Let me explain why."
- "Which brings me to the real secret."
- "Now here's the thing..."

Use 2-4 per page. Every paragraph ending with "but there's more" gets tiresome.

### The partial reveal

> "The formula has three parts. The first one is obvious. The third one is counterintuitive. But the second one? That's where the magic happens."

Now they need to know the second part.

### Closing loops

You must close every loop you open. Tease "the one thing that changed everything" and never deliver? They'll never trust you again.

Small loops: close within 1-3 paragraphs. Big loops: close by the end of the piece.

---

## Flow techniques: the slippery slide

Sugarman: "Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slide."

Once they start, they can't stop. Every element pulls them to the next.

### Bucket brigades

Short phrases that smooth transitions between paragraphs:

- And
- So
- Now
- But
- Look
- Here's why
- Truth is
- Turns out
- The result?
- Think about it

**Without:** "Most landing pages focus on features. Benefits are what customers care about."

**With:** "Most landing pages focus on features. Here's the thing: Benefits are what customers care about."

The transition phrase smooths entry into the second paragraph.

### The stutter technique

Repeat a word from the last sentence in the first sentence of the next paragraph:

> "Now we're going to look at a more sophisticated technique.
>
> A technique used by professional writers, but often overlooked by copywriters."

"Technique" bridges the gap. Smoother than starting fresh.

### Short first sentences

The first sentence of any section should be stupidly easy to read:

> "It's simple."

> "Here's the problem."

> "This works."

Low friction to start. Momentum builds from there.

### Vary paragraph length

Same-length paragraphs = monotonous reading.

Short.

Then a medium paragraph that expands with more detail.

Then short again.

This creates rhythm. The eye moves easily.

### Momentum killers

- Jargon they have to pause to understand
- Long paragraphs with no breaks
- Tangents that don't connect to the main thread
- Weak transitions that jar the reader
- Same sentence structure repeated too many times

---

## Pain quantification

Vague problems feel overwhelming. Quantified problems feel solvable.

Don't just describe the pain. Do the math:

> "4 hrs to set up emails + 6 hrs designing a landing page + 4 hrs to handle Stripe webhooks + 2 hrs for SEO tags + ∞ hrs overthinking...
>
> = 22+ hours of headaches.
>
> There's an easier way."

When readers see "22+ hours," they calculate whether that's worth paying to eliminate. You've turned abstract frustration into a number they can weigh against your price.

Another approach: the scenario that makes them feel it:

> "Imagine the scene: you and your team get an urgent email, so you rapidly reply. But just after you hit send, your team replies as well. In the best case, you look disorganized. In the worst case, you contradict each other."

They've been there. Now they feel the problem instead of just acknowledging it.

---

## The So What? Chain

AI stops at the first layer of benefit. "Saves time." "Increases productivity." "Helps you grow." Weak.

For every feature, ask "so what?" until you hit something emotional or financial:

> **Feature:** Fast database
> "So what?"
> **Functional:** Queries load in milliseconds
> "So what?"
> **Financial:** Users don't bounce, revenue doesn't leak
> "So what?"
> **Emotional:** You stop waking up stressed about churn

The bottom of the chain is where the copy lives. Not "saves 4 hours" but "close your laptop at 5pm instead of 9pm." Not "automates outreach" but "wake up to replies instead of a blank inbox."

Three levels deep. Then write from there.

---

## Rhythm: alternation

Here's where most AI-generated copy fails. It's either all choppy fragments or all flowing paragraphs. Real human writing alternates.

Short sentence. Impact. Then a longer one that breathes, adds context, feels like actual conversation.

Watch how Hormozi does it:

> "Customers do NOT buy code. Customers buy a life transformation."

Punchy. Declarative. Repeated structure.

Now Justin Welsh:

> "Once upon a time, you had a job. You traded hours for dollars, clocked in and out, and waited for the weekend. Your skills were confined to a cubicle and your ambitions to an annual review and a 4% raise."

Longer. Conversational. Building through parallel structure.

Both work. The key is knowing when to punch and when to breathe.

**The pattern:**
- Hook (short, sharp)
- Expand (breathe, add context)
- Land it (kicker that punctuates)

Then repeat.

---

## The founder story

Almost every high-converting creator page includes a first-person story. The format: humble origins, struggle, discovery, success, offer.

> "Hey, it's Marc 👋 In 2018, I believed I was Mark Zuckerberg, built a startup for 1 year, and got 0 users... A few years after my burnout, I restarted the journey differently: I shipped like a madman. 16 startups in 2 years. Now I'm happy and earn $45,000 a month."

Why this works:
- Self-deprecating humor ("I believed I was Mark Zuckerberg") disarms skepticism
- Specific numbers ("16 startups in 2 years," "$45,000 a month") prove results
- The implicit message: I was where you are. I found the answer. Here it is.

The arc is always: **vulnerability → credibility → shared journey**

If you're writing for a founder, get their story. This isn't optional. It's the highest-trust element on the page.

---

## Testimonials

Generic testimonials ("Great product!") carry zero persuasive weight. Structure them as mini case studies:

> **[Before state] + [action taken] + [specific outcome] + [timeframe] + [emotional reaction]**

Examples:
- "I shipped in 6 days as a noob coder. It would have taken me months. I wanna cry 🥲"
- "I managed to exit and sell for 5 figures in a few weeks. Best investment I've made in so long."
- "We were able to buy our first business within 4 months of joining."

The specifics are everything. "4 months" is believable. "Helped me succeed" is not.

**Authority stacking:** If you have recognizable names, lead with them. Borrowed credibility creates instant trust transfer.

---

## Disqualification

This feels counterintuitive but works consistently. Tell certain people they're not a fit:

> "You're a good fit for this if:
> ✅ You know this is a tool, and you'll need to use it
> ✅ You're willing to reassess your existing ideas
>
> You're NOT a good fit if:
> ❌ You equate success with just buying a course
> ❌ You're not willing to do the unsexy work required"

Why this converts: It flips from "please buy" to "prove you're worthy." Velvet rope effect. Also pre-filters customers likely to complain.

Even simpler, for handling objections:

> "Couldn't I just do this myself with all the free content out there?"
>
> "If you could, you would have already. 🤷🏻"

---

## CTAs

Weak CTAs command action. Strong CTAs describe the benefit:

- "Sign Up" → "Get ShipFast"
- "Learn More" → "See the exact template I used"
- "Subscribe" → "Send me the first lesson free"
- "Buy Now" → "Start building"

Below the CTA, add friction reducers:

> "$199 once. Join 2,600+ marketers. 2 minutes to install."

Pattern: **[Risk reversal] + [Social proof] + [Speed/ease]**

---

## Internet-native voice markers

Patterns that signal "written by someone who lives online, not a marketing team":

**Revenue transparency:**
- "Now I'm happy and earn $45,000 a month"
- Specific numbers that would make corporate uncomfortable

**Honest limitations:**
- "One note: 3D model generation isn't great yet"
- Acknowledging imperfection builds authenticity

**Strategic emoji:**
- "I wanna cry 🥲"
- Use sparingly but deliberately

**In-group language:**
- "Ship like a madman"
- "Indie hacker" / "solopreneur"
- Language your audience uses with each other

---

## The full sequence

When building a complete landing page:

1. **Hook** — Outcome headline with specific number or timeframe
2. **Problem** — Quantify the pain (hours wasted, money lost)
3. **Agitate** — Scenario or story that makes the problem vivid
4. **Credibility** — Founder story, authority endorsements, or proof numbers
5. **Solution** — What the product does, framed as transformation
6. **Proof** — Testimonials with specific outcomes
7. **Objections** — FAQ or "fit/not fit" section
8. **Offer** — Pricing with value justification
9. **Urgency** — Only if authentic
10. **Final CTA** — Benefit-oriented, friction reducers below

You don't need all ten every time. But this is the complete arc when you need it.

## AI tells to avoid

Readers are getting better at spotting AI-generated content. These patterns destroy trust instantly.

**Overused words:**
- "delve" / "dive into" / "dig into"
- "comprehensive" / "robust" / "cutting-edge"
- "utilize" (just say "use")
- "leverage" (as a verb)
- "crucial" / "vital" / "essential"
- "unlock" / "unleash" / "supercharge"
- "game-changer" / "revolutionary"
- "landscape" / "navigate" / "streamline"

**Overused phrases:**
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "In order to..." (just say "to")
- "Whether you're a... or a..."
- "Are you ready to take your X to the next level?"
- "Let's dive in" / "Without further ado"

**Punctuation tells:**
- Too many em-dashes (limit to 1-2 per piece, use periods instead)
- Long sentences with 4+ commas (break them up)
- Colons in titles repeatedly
- Semicolons where periods would work

**Structural tells:**
- Every paragraph is the same length
- Every bullet point starts the same way
- Overly organized with too many headings
- Bold on every key term
- Numbered lists where the numbers don't matter

**Voice tells:**
- Passive voice throughout
- No "I" or "you" anywhere
- Hedging: "some may find," "it's possible that," "can potentially"
- No contractions
- Perfectly grammatical but lifeless

**The fix:**

Read your copy out loud. If you stumble, a reader will too. If it sounds like a textbook, rewrite it.

Real humans:
- Use contractions
- Write sentence fragments sometimes
- Have opinions without hedging
- Use "I" and "you" freely
- Make unexpected word choices

## Example transformation

**Generic:**
> "Our comprehensive SaaS boilerplate helps developers launch faster with cutting-edge features and best practices built in."

**Internet-native:**
> "Ship your startup in days, not weeks.
>
> You know the drill. You've got an idea, you're excited, and then you spend the next month setting up authentication, payment processing, email templates, and DNS records. By the time the boring stuff is done, you've lost momentum. Or worse, someone else shipped first.
>
> ShipFast is everything you need to launch, nothing you don't. Stripe, emails, SEO, auth. Done. You write your features, we handle the infrastructure.
>
> 2,894 makers ship faster with ShipFast. The next one could be you.
>
> Get ShipFast →"

The second version: specific numbers, pain quantification, transformation focus, social proof, benefit-oriented CTA. And it sounds like a person wrote it.

---

## The test

Before you ship, read it out loud. Ask:

1. Does it sound like someone talking, or someone "writing copy"?
2. Would I actually say this to a friend?
3. Is every claim backed by a specific number or proof?
4. Does the rhythm alternate (punchy moments, then breathing room)?
5. Is it about THEM (their transformation) or about ME (my product)?
6. Are there open loops pulling them forward?
7. Does it end with momentum?

If any answer is no, rewrite that part.

The goal isn't to hide that you're selling. It's to sell like a human, with honesty, specificity, and respect for the reader's intelligence.

## Working with SEO content (frontmatter preservation)

When enhancing content from `/seo-content`, preserve and update the YAML frontmatter.

### What to preserve (don't change)
- title
- slug
- author
- date
- primary_keyword
- categories
- canonical_url
- schema_type

### What to update
- **status:** Change from "draft" to "review" after enhancement
- **word_count:** Recalculate if content length changed significantly
- **keyword_density:** Recalculate if word count changed
- **internal_links:** Add any new links introduced
- **external_citations:** Add any new sources cited

### What to enhance (while preserving)
- **meta_title:** Punch up if weak, but keep under 60 chars and include keyword
- **meta_description:** Rewrite for click-through if bland, keep 150-160 chars
- **og_title:** Can be more engaging than meta_title for social
- **og_description:** Optimise for social sharing

### Output format

When receiving SEO content with frontmatter, output the complete article with:
1. Updated frontmatter (preserved fields + updated fields)
2. Enhanced body content
3. All original sections maintained

**Example frontmatter update:**

```yaml
# Update these fields after enhancement:
status: "review"  # Changed from "draft"
word_count: "2847"  # Recalculated
keyword_density: "1.4%"  # Recalculated

# Keep these unchanged:
title: "[Original title]"
slug: "[original-slug]"
primary_keyword: "[original keyword]"
```
