# E-E-A-T Patterns (Quick Reference)

## 7 Universal Patterns

- **First-Person Experience:** Not "studies show" but "I found." The writer is present in the work.
- **Specific Numbers:** Not "many" but "248 people" or "14 days" or "$22M."
- **Named Sources:** Real people, real companies, real quotes. Not "experts say."
- **Contrarian Angles:** Challenging conventional wisdom with reasoning and evidence.
- **Admitted Limitations:** "This won't work for everyone" or "I was wrong about this."
- **Clear Voice:** Identifiable without a byline. Not generic, not corporate, not committee.
- **Original Insight:** Something you can't find by aggregating other sources.

## 5 Questions Before Writing

1. What's my specific experience with this topic?
2. What numbers can I cite from actual work?
3. What's my actual opinion here?
4. What would I tell a smart friend who asked about this?
5. What can only I say about this?

## Red Flags

- **Aggregation without insight:** "Here are 10 things I read about X" with no POV
- **Research without application:** Citations but no "here's what I did with this"
- **Balance without conviction:** "Some say X, others say Y" and never committing
- **Expertise without stories:** Technical depth but no human moments
- **Generic advice:** Could apply to anyone, helps no one specifically
