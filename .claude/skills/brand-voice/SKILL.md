description: "Define or extract a consistent brand voice that other skills can use. Two modes - Extract (analyze existing content you're proud of) or Build (strategically construct a voice from scratch). Use when starting a project, when copy sounds generic, or when output needs to sound like a specific person/brand. Triggers on: what's my voice, analyze my brand, help me define my voice, make this sound like me, voice guide, brand personality. Outputs a voice profile that can be fed into direct-response-copy and other content skills."

# Brand Voice

## The core job

Create a **voice profile** that other skills can reference to produce on-brand output. The profile should be specific enough that anyone (human or AI) could read it and write consistently on-brand.

**Output format:** Use the voice profile template in `onboard-client/profile-template.md`. The profile contains: voice summary, personality traits, tone spectrum, vocabulary guide, rhythm/structure patterns, example phrases, and do's/don'ts.

## Two modes

### Mode 1: Extract
**Use when:** They have existing content they're proud of (website copy, emails, social posts, newsletters, video transcripts).

**Process:** Analyse the content for patterns, then codify what makes it distinctive.

### Mode 2: Build
**Use when:** Starting fresh, existing content is weak/generic, or they want to evolve their voice strategically.

**Process:** Ask strategic questions, then construct a voice aligned with their identity, audience, and positioning.

**How to choose:** Ask: "Do you have existing content that represents how you want to sound?"

- **Yes, I have content I'm proud of** → Extract mode
- **No, I'm starting fresh** → Build mode
- **I have content but want to evolve** → Build mode (with existing content as reference for what to keep/change)

## Mode 1: Extract

### What to analyse

Request 3-5 pieces of content they consider "most them": website copy (especially About page, homepage), emails, high-performing social posts, newsletter editions, video/podcast transcripts, anything where they felt "this sounds like me."

### What to look for

**1. Tone patterns**
- Formal ↔ Casual (contractions? slang? sentence fragments?)
- Serious ↔ Playful (humour? lightness? gravity?)
- Reserved ↔ Bold (hedging? strong claims? confidence?)
- Distant ↔ Intimate (we/they vs I/you? personal stories?)

**2. Vocabulary patterns**
- Industry jargon level (heavy, light, translated?)
- Signature words or phrases they repeat
- Words they avoid
- Curse words or edgy language?
- Formal words vs everyday words

**3. Rhythm patterns**
- Average sentence length
- Paragraph length
- Mix of short punchy vs longer flowing
- Use of fragments and lists

**4. Structural patterns**
- How they open (story? question? statement?)
- How they transition
- How they close (CTA style? summary? open loop?)
- Headers and formatting preferences

**5. Personality signals**
- Self-deprecating or confident?
- Teacher or peer?
- Polished or raw?
- Optimistic or realistic?
- References and examples they use

**6. POV patterns**
- First person (I) or plural (we)?
- How they address reader (you? folks? friends?)
- Direct address or general statements?

After analysis, produce the voice profile using `onboard-client/profile-template.md`.

## Mode 2: Build

### Strategic questions to ask

**Identity:**
1. What are 3-5 words that describe your personality?
2. What do you stand for? What's your core belief about your industry/topic?
3. What's your background? What shaped how you see things?
4. What makes you genuinely different from others in your space?

**Audience:**
5. Who are you talking to? (Be specific)
6. What tone resonates with them? (What do they respond to?)
7. What would make them trust you? What would turn them off?

**Positioning:**
8. Are you the expert, the peer, the rebel, the guide, the insider?
9. Where do you sit on accessible ↔ exclusive?
10. Where do you sit on approachable ↔ authoritative?

**Aspiration:**
11. Name 2-3 brands or people whose voice you admire. What specifically do you like about how they communicate?
12. What do you explicitly NOT want to sound like?

**Practical:**
13. Any words or phrases that are signature to you?
14. Any words or phrases you hate or want to avoid?
15. How do you feel about humour? Profanity? Hot takes?

### Build process

From the answers, construct voice profile:

1. **Synthesise personality** → Core traits that should come through
2. **Define tone spectrum** → Where they land on key dimensions
3. **Set vocabulary rules** → What to use, what to avoid
4. **Establish rhythm** → Sentence/paragraph patterns that fit
5. **Create examples** → Write sample phrases that embody the voice
6. **Define boundaries** → What's off-brand

## When to revisit

- Brand evolves, pivots, or audience changes significantly
- Content starts feeling inconsistent or isn't converting

---

## The test

A good voice profile passes these checks:

- **Recognisable:** Could someone identify content as "theirs" without a byline?
- **Actionable:** Could a writer produce on-brand content using only the profile?
- **Differentiated:** Does it sound different from competitors?

If any answer is no, the profile needs more specificity.
